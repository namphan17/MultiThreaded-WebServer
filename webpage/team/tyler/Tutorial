        Wireshark Basic Tutorial
    </h1>
    <p>
        So, one of the tools we've begun learning about so far is called Wireshark. Wireshark is what's called a 'packet sniffer'.
    Basically, that means that its a tool that can read, and then display a copy, of all the packets of data being sent from or
    received by our computer. Packet sniffers can be extremely useful tools, but they can also be used for pretty awful things.
    Since the packet sniffer just reads and copies packets, and doesn't actually interact with the actual packets themselves or
    try to add anything to them, they can be really hard to detect. And so they can be easy to sneak in somewhere, and if the
    person using it can decrypt the packets, they can potentially get access to all sorts of things. Passwords, SSN's, that sort
    of thing. So its important we know how they work, both to use them for their intended purposes, and to better be able to
    protect ourselves from them.
    <br><br>
        Anyways, so Wireshark. Go ahead and open the wireshark application by searching for it on your computer. Once you get it
    open, you'll see that it we get an error message, permission denied. I don't remember entirely why that happens, something
    about not having admin priveleges to the network, which would make sense. Thankfully Paul was kind enough to send everyone
    test packages to open with Wireshark that simulate what we'd get if we actually ran the program. Go ahead and open one of
    them. Any of them will do really. They seem to default to opening with Wireshark on these computers, so its pretty handy.
    Normally, instead of getting an error message, it'd show you a list of interfaces. Simply clicking on one of them would
    open up a similar screen.
    <br><br>
        Once you've got a test package up, take a look at the buttons up top. Hovering over the buttons will tell you what
    those buttons are. Honestly, all of the options are self-explanatory to anyone whos ever used something as simple as Word.
    And considering this is a 300 level comp-sci course, I'm going to assume you've used something similar to Word before.
    <br><br>
        Beneath those buttons, you'll see a line that asks you for a display filter. Honestly, we haven't used that a ton yet,
    but it lets us filter out what sorts of packets we want to see. For instance, try typing 'http' without the quotes. You'll
    probably get far fewer results.
    <br><br>
        Moving on, beneath the filter,you'll see a list of all the various packets Wiresharks captured, along with that
    packets info in the window below. Finally, below that is the packet-content window. This window shows the contents of
    the packet in ASCII, and hexadecimal.
    <br><br>
        That's about all we've covereso far , as far as I can remember. It's a pretty easy tool to use. Good lucK!
