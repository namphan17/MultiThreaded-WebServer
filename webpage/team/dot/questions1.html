	<li class="question">Explain the TCP three-way handshake which starts a connection.</li>
	<ol>
		<li class="answer">When TCP is opening a connection, the client sends out a packet asking to open a new connection with the
			server.</li>
		<li class="answer">The server responds with an acknowledgement of that request and its own request to do the same.
			At this point the server is now open to receive any requests from the client.</li>
		<li class="answer">The client responds to the server's request with an acknowledgement of its own.
			At this point the client is open to receive further response packets from the server.</li>

	<li class="question">What function do cookies serve? Why is this function necessary?</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="answer"><strike><b>They are delicious and I want them</b></strike><span style="color:blue"><sup>[citation needed]</sup></span>.</li>
		<li class="answer">HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means no information about a user's previous actions are stored.
			Cookies allow the storage of some information for use on multiple pages, such as login information or the contents
			of a user's cart on a shopping site.</li>
	</ul>
	<li class="question">Give at least two reasons why it would be a bad idea to have a single, centralized DNS server.</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="answer">If that server crashes, so does the entire internet (single point of failure)</li>
		<li class="answer">The sheer number of requests passing through would cause significant delay</li>
		<li class="answer">That server cannot be equally close to everything, unless it is at the earth's core, but no matter
			where it is a large number of people will experience significant propagation delays</li>
		<li class="answer">The database would have to be constantly updated with any changes, which would be difficult as the
			database of all internet addresses would be very large.</li>
	</ul>
	<li class="question">What makes Selective Repeat different from Go Back N? Which is used in modern protocols?</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">When a packet is lost, Go Back N will resend all packets within a certain margin of the lost packet. 
		When a packet is lost, Selective Repeat will begin resending packets at the lost packet, potentially skipping back to fresh
		packets when it receives an acknowledgement for all packets sent so far. Selective Repeat is currently more frequently used
		because it has less of a chance of sending duplicate packets and clogging the network.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">What does a triple duplicate ACK response signify in TCP? What is done in response to the ACKs?</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">A triple duplicate ACK response means that the other host has failed to receive at least one packet,
		so the host will begin resending packets starting at the segment number indicated by the triple duplicate ACK.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">Why would you not want to use the maximum possible packet delay for the timeout to declare a packet lost?</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">While the maximum possible delay would ensure that packets are actually lost before resending them, 
		there are few enough occasions where the packet is discovered to have arrived safely close with almost maximum delay
		that the amount of wasted bandwidth from resending packets which were simply incredibly delayed is not considered more
		significant than the time saved by waiting less.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">Briefly explain how a datagram network handles routing.</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">When an end system wishes to send a packet, the IP address of the destination is placed in the packet's
		header. The packet is then passed to a router, which consults its forwarding table to see which prefix best matches the
		destination address. The packet is sent along the route closest to its destination, and continues being passed from router
		to router in this fashion until it arrives at its destination.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">Briefly explain transport-layer multiplexing and demultiplexing.</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">Multiplexing is when the transport layer gathers all data chunks going to the same IP into one large
		segment and sends it to the network layer. Demultiplexing is when the receiving system takes that large segment and divides
		it up, sending each data chunk to its final destination socket.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">What could make UDP preferable to TCP?</li>
	<ul>
		<li class="answer">Less packet overhead</li>
		<li class="answer">No delay to establish a connection</li>
		<li class="answer">No connection state, so more connections may be open at once</li>
	</ul>
	<li class="question">Explain Head-of-Line blocking.</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">Suppose there are two input and output ports within a router, each labeled A and B. Input port A has a
		single large packet going to output port A. Input port B has a large packet going to output port A and a smaller packet
		behind it going to output port B. The router starts moving the packet from input port A to output port A, so the first
		packet in input port B must wait until the packet from input port A has finished before it can start moving. Even though
		output port B is free and ready to accept packets, the second packet cannot start being moved, because <b>the packet at the
		head of the line is blocking it</b>.</li></ul>

	<li class="question">Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department. Can you propose a way to 
		roughly determine the Web servers (outside your	department) that are most popular among the users in your department? Explain.</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">As a DNS cache utilizes TTL for its records, it must also store the last time they were accessed.
		With this in mind, you could regularly check the cache to see which records have been recently modified.
		Whichever records were modified the most frequently would be the ones which users visited the most.</li></ul>
	<li class="question">Consider an HTTP client that wants to retrieve a Web document at a given URL. The IP address of the
		HTTP server is initially unknown. What transport and application-layer protocols besides HTTP are needed in this scenario?</li>
	<ul><li class="answer">DNS is needed to find the IP address of the server containing the information, TCP is needed to transmit
		the data received, and an application will be needed to display the data to the user.</li></ul>
