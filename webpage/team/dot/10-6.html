        Notes for October 6th
    </h1>
    <h2>SMTP</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Defined in RFC 5321</li>
	<li>Transfers messages between sender and recipient mail servers</li>
	<li>Older than HTTP</li>
	<li>Age lends itself to archaic restrictions which have yet to be phased out</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Body and headers of all messages restricted to 7-bit ASCII</li>
		<li>Fun fact: part of my father's job used to be making sure email signatures were less than 3 lines long and therefore able to be handled by the server</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Order of operations</li>
	<ol>
		<li>User A invokes user agent for email, provides email address of user B, writes a message, and instructs user agent to send it</li>
		<li>User A's user agent sends the message to the mail server, where it is placed in a message queue</li>
		<li>Client side SMTP on User A's mail server sees the message in the queue and opens a TCP connection to an SMTP server on User B's mail server</li>
		<li>SMTP client and server initialize a connection and the client sends the message</li>
		<li>Server SMTP receives the message and places it in User B's mailbox</li>
		<li>User B invokes user agent to read the message from User A</li>
	</ol>
	<li>SMTP does not use intermediate mail servers</li>
	<li>If the destination server is down, the sending server holds onto the message until it can be sent</li>
	<li>SMTP uses port 25</li>
</ul>
