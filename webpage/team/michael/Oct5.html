<h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
    <p>
     A server is a computer that <i>serves</i> items to other computers. The server is called the <i>host</i>, and the other computers requesting items from the server are called <i>clients.</i> Applications with a client-server architecture include: 
    </p>
<ul>
<li>Web</li>
<li>FTP</li>
<li>Telnet</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>
A data center is a collection of servers. Large internet service providers like google have many datacenters numbering in the hundreds of thousands of servers. 
</p>

<h2>P2P Architecture</h2>
<p>In P2P there is no need 
for servers. applications exploit communication between two connected hosts called <i>peers</i>. Becuase these hosts communicate directly, it is called a  <i>peer-to-peer</i> connection. P2P applications include
<ul>
<li>File Sharing (Torrents)</li>
<li>Download acceleration</li>
<li>Telephony(Skype)</li>
<li>IPTV(Internet Protocol Television)</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>P2P can distribute the workload of large processes over multiple machines. Seti@Home was one of the first public distributed computing projects where users participated in the analysis of space sounds (radio signals). Videogames utilize P2P where the games are hosted by players, as opposed to dedicated servers. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops used P2P. If the host left the game the game would wait for a host migration or the players would be disconnected. </p>
<h2>Two types of P2P</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unstructured</li>
<li>Structured</li>

<p> An unstructured network has peers randomly connecting to some subset of all peers. This doesn't scale particularly well. The main disadvantage is the need to search the entire network to find something</p>
<p>A common type of structured P2P is a distributed hash table (DHT), in which a variant of consistent hashing is used to assign ownership of each file to a particular peer</p>
