<button class="accordion">Framing</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Most link layer protocols contain network layer datagrams within a link layer frame
      before it transmits over the link. The structure of the frame is defined by the link
       layer protocol.
  </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Link access</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Medium access control (MAC) protocol specifies rules of frames transmitted onto links. 
      For point to point links that have a single sender and receiver, MAC is simple or nonexistent so the sender 
      can send a frame whenever the link is in idle. If multiple nodes share a single link, MAC 
      serves to coordinate the frame transmissions of the multiple nodes. 
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Reliable Delivery</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A guarantee to move each network-layer datagram across the link without error. Can be achieved with acknowledgments and retransmissions.
       often used for links that are prone to high error rates, such as a wireless link. The goal is correcting
an error locally-on the link where the error occurs
  </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Error detection and correction</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The link-layer hardware in a receiving node can
incorrectly decide bits in a frame. These bit errors are introduced by signal attenuation and electromagnetic
noise. There is no need to forward a datagram that has an error, so 
many link-layer protocols provide a way to detect bit errors. This is
done by making the transmitting node include error-detection bits in the frame,
and making the receiving node perform an error check. Error detection in the link layer
is usually implemented in hardware. Error correction
is similar to error detection, except that a receiver not only detects when bit
errors have occurred in the frame, but also determines exactly where in the frame
the errors have occurred.</p>
