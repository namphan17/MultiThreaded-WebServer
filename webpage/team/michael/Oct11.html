Reliable Data Transfer
</h1>

<body>
    <p>Implementations of reliable data transfer occur in the transport, link
        , and application layer. In a reliable channel, no bits are corrupted
         or lost. They are delivered in the exact order that they are sent. 
    </p>
    <h3>Reliable Data Transfer Protocol: rdt1.0</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Finite-State Machine(FSM): <i>an abstract machine that 
            can be in one of a finite number of states</i></li>
            <li>rdt1.0: <i>A protocol for a completely relaible channel</i></li>
   
    </ul>
    <p>There are two different FSMs for rdt1.0. A sender FSM and reciever FSM. Each only have one state. Since There
         is only one state in each the transitions are right back to the same state. 
         The sending protocol accepts data from the upper layer using <b>rdt_send(data)</b>
          event and and creates a packet containing the data
           with <b>make_pkt(data)</b>, and sends that packet to a channel. The reciever recieves data through a 
          channel using <b>rdt_rcv(packet)</b>, processes the data with <b>extract(packet, data)</b>.  with a perfectly reliable
channel there is no need for the receiver side to provide any feedback to the sender
since nothing can go wrong. The receiver recieves just as fast as the faster sends so there is no need
for the reciever to tell the sender to slow down.
    </p>
<h3>Reliable Data Transfer rdt2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li> Bits in a packet
may be corrupted</li>
<li>Physical components of a
network as a packet is transmitted, propagates, or is buffered</li>
<li>ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest) protocols:  <i>allow the receiver to let the sender know what has been received correctly
      reliable data transfer protocols based on retransmission</i>
</li>
</ul>
