<h1>
Principles of Congestion Control
</h1>
</head>

<body>
    <p>Packet loss typically results from
the overflowing of router buffers as the network becomes congested. Packet retransmission is a way
to treat the problem of network congestion, but does not solve the the underlying issue: many sources
sending data at too high of a rate. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Available bit-rate (ABR) service</li>
    <li>Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network</li>
</ul>
<h3>Causes of Congestion</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Allergies, hay fever, enviornmental irritants, chronic sinusitis, deviated Setpum.(Jokes)</li>
    <li>Two senders and infinite router buffer</li>
    <li>Two senders and finite router buffer</li>
    <li> Four Senders, Routers with Finite Buffers, and
Multihop Paths</li>
</ul>
<h3>Vocab</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Per-Connection througput: <i>number of bytes per second at the reciever</i></li>
    <li>Offered Load: <i>The rate at which the transport layer sends segments into the 
        network in bytes/second</i></li>
<li>End-to-end congestion control: <i>no explicit support to transport layer. </i></li>
<li>Network-assisted congestion control: <i>network-layer components provide explicit
     feedback to the sender regarding congestion state</i></li>
     <li>Choke packet: <i>direct feedback from network router to sender about congestion</i></li>
<li>Resource-management cells(RMC): <i>used to convey congestion-related information 
    among hosts and switches</i></li>
    <li>Explicit forward congestion indication bit(EFCI bit): <i>each data cell contains an EFCI
         bit. Set to one means there is congestion.</i></li>
</ul>
