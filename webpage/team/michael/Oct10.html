Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
</h1>

<body>
<p>    A multiplexing/demultiplexing 
    service is needed for all computer networks. Your computer
    recieves data through the transport layer and is redirected
    to different processes. For example if are downloading web 
    pages on one FTP session and two Telnet sessions, there are 
    4 process: one FTP, two Telnet, one HTTP. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sockets:<i> doors that pass data from the processes to
        network, and from the network to processes.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Because at any time there can be more than one socket in 
    the recieving host, each socket has a unique identifier. 
    Identifiers depend the types UDP or TCP socket. </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Demultiplexing: <i> the job of delivering data in a transport-layer
        segment to the correct socket.</i></li>
        <li>Multiplexing:<i> The job of collecting data chunks
            at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating header info, creating
             segments, and passing the segments to the network layer.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that multiplexing and demultiplexing 
    are used when a single protocol in one layer is used by multiple 
    protocols at the next layer above it. Special fields that indicate
     the socket for segments to be delivered to are <i>source port number field</i>, and <i>destination port number field</i>.
Each port number is a 16-bit integer ranging from 0 - 65535. The port 
numbers ranging from 0 - 1023 are called <i>well-known port numbers</i> and are restricted. This means
 that they are reserved for well known applicaiton protocols such as HTTP and FTP. Every new application
  must be assigned the application port number. UDP basically does
  multi and demultiplexing by assigning each socket in the host a port 
  number, so when a segment is recieved at the host, the transport
   layer examines the destination port number and sends that segment to the 
   corresponding socket.
</p>
<h4>Connectionless Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</h4>
<p>A UDP socket is identified by a pair that has
a destination IP address and a destination port number. Therefore, if two
UDP segments have different source IP addresses / source port numbers, but have
the same destination IP address / destination port number, then the two segments
will be directed to the same destination process via the same destination socket</p>
<h4>Connection-Oriented Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</h4>
<p>One difference between a TCP and UDP socket is that a TCP is defined
    by a 4 tuple: source
IP address, source port number, destination IP address, destination port number. 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>TCP server applications have a socket that waits for established connection 
        requests from the clients on port number 1200.
    </li>
    <li>A connection-establishment request is a TCP segment 
        with port number 1200, with a special connection-establishment bit set
         in the header, and the segment includes a source port number that is chosen by the client. 
    </li>
</ul>
