	<li>Routing and Routing Algorithms</li><br> 
	<ul><li>Least-Cost Path: A path among routers that is the most cost efficient, or takes the least cost. </li><br>
	<li>Shortest Path: A shortest path may be a least-cost path. However, a shortest path algorithm tries to find the route with the shortest amount of links between the source and destination.</li><br>
	<li>Global Routing Algorithms: These algorithms, called <strong>Link-State Algorithms</strong>, compute the shortest path between hosts using global knowledge about the network. This algorithm knows all states and costs of each link in the network. </li><br> 
	<li>Decentralized Routing Algorithm: These algorithms calculate the least-cost path without complete information, unlike the global routing algorithms. Rather, it finds the least-cost path through iterative processes.</li>
	</ul><br><hr><br> 
	<li>Characteristics of Routing Algorithms</li><br>
	<ul><li>Static Routing Algorithms: These routing algorithms change very slowly over time, usually because of some sort of human intervention.</li><br> 
	<li>Dynamic Routing Algorithms: These routing algorithms change dynamically based on traffic load, network congestion, or topology/cost changes.</li><br>
	<li>There are also load-sensitive algorithms, which chooses to find routes around congested links that are still relatively short. If a router becomes majorly congested, then this characteristic of an algorithm will find a route around the congested link. Contrary to this, there are also load-insensitive algorithms which ignore congestion within links.</li>
