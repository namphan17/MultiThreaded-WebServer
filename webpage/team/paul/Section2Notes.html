<h1>Notes on HTTP (Section 2)</h1>
</head>
<body>
<ol>
	<li>HTTP is called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol</li> 
	<ul><li>Used in practice to get website files (.html files, .shtml files, etc.) which are then displayed in the browser</li> 
	<li>Client performs a request in HTTP:<br>
	<br><hr>
	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1<br>
	Host: www.google.com<br><br><hr>
	</li>
	<li>Server Responds with an acknowledgement:<br>
	<br><hr>
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>

</li></ul><br>Types of Requests</li> 
	<ul> 
	<li>GET: Grabbing a specific file from the webpage (which is most likely a .html, .shtml, etc.) for the browser to display</li><br>
	<li>POST: Sending information to grab a file from the webpage, but after information is submitted (the client POSTS something to webpage first)<li><br>
	<li>PUT: Client is putting a file on a webserver</li><br>
	<li>DELETE: Client is requesting a deletion of a file on a webserver</li><br>
	</ul><br>
<li>User-Agent Usefullness: </li> 
	<ul> 
	<li>User-Agent: When client requests a webpage via a browser, a user-agent is sent to tell the webserver how to display the data that it transmits</li><br>
	<li>Ex. Mozilla 5/0, Gecko/30909, etc.</li><br>
	</ul><br> 
<li>Cookies and Us</li> 
	<ul>
	<li>Cookies are often sent to the user in a response request (or after a POST request) to help the browser remember who the user was when the website was visited</li> <br>
	<li>Example of cookie getting set:
	
	<br><hr>
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK<br>

</li></ul> 
<li>HTTP vs. HTTPS</li> 
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP often sends data in cleartext, so those sniffing any HTTP request or response packets will be able to clearly see the data being transferred (even if it's sensitive)</li><br> 
		<li>HTTPS encrypts the transport layer of a packet, making it hard to see the cleartext of the website responses because it because it becomes encrypted in SSL</li><br>
	</ul>
<li>HTTP is stateless</li> 
	<ul>
		<li>HTTP is terminated after the client is done interacting with the webserver (either non-persistent or persistent), unless cookies are used or placed in the browsers cache.</li><br>
	</ul>
