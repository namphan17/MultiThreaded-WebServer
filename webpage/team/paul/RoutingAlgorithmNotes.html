	<li>Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol</li><br> 
	<ul><li>This algorithm implements source-based multicast routing with reverse path forwarding and includes pruning techniques. </li><br>
	<li>Reverse path forwarding used by this algorithm broadcasts the packets to all surrounding nodes within a specific subset. When the packet is split among nodes, it uses a pruning technique to get rid of the packets heading to nodes that don't need them (they aren't part of the multicast group). Simply put, if a router or node, receives a packet that is directed towards hosts that aren't in it's multicast, then it will let all other routers know by sending prune messages via the upstream route.</li><br>

	<li>Protocol Independent Multicast Routing Protocol</li><br>
	<ul><li>This algorithmic protocol has two states that it can be in on a network. That is, it can be set in either <strong>Dense</strong> mode or <strong>Sparse</strong> mode. </li><br> 
	<li>The <strong>Dense</strong> mdoe of this networking algorithm is similar to that of DVMRP in structer in which it uses RPF and pruning to contact all hosts in a multicast.</li><br>
	<li>The <strong>Sparse</strong> mode, however, rendezvous points are used to set up the multicast distribution tree. For an example, see the image below.</li><br>
	Example of Sparse Mode in PIM:<br>
