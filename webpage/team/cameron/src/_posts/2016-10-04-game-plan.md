What are we doing in this course as a whole?

### Packets

- What are packets called in different layers?
  - (messages, segments, datagrams, frames)
- How many bits per packet?
- What kinds of info does packet carry?
- How is packet divided/organized?

### Naming/Addressing

- IP Addresses: v4 and v6
- Ports
- MAC Addresses

### Routing

- Describe and classify algorithms
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

### Reliable Transport

- Modeling using Finite State Machine

### Not covered in readings, but interesting nonetheless

- Security
- Wireless
