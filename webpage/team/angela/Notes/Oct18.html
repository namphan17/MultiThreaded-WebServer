<ul>	

<li><b>Multicast</b>: Multicast packets are delieverd only to a subset of network nodes.</li>
<li><b>Address indirection</b>: Multicast packets can't hold the addresses of all the destinationsit would be <b>too much</b>. Instead use a single identifier for a group of receivers, packets with the identifier are copies and delivered to all the multicast receivers associated with that group.</li>
<li><b>Multicast group</b>: Group of receivers associated with a class D address (multicast identifier)</li>
<li>Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP)</li>
<ul>
<li>The IGMP protocol version 3 perates between a host and its directly attached router </li>

<li>IGMP provides the means for a host to inform its attached router that an application
running on the host wants to join a specific multicast group. Given that the scope of
IGMP interaction is limited to a host and its attached router, another protocol is clearly required to coordinate the multicast routers throughout the Internet, so that multicast datagrams are routed to their final destinations. This latter
functionality is accomplished by network-layer multicast routing algorithms, such as
those we will consider shortly. Network-layer multicast in the Internet thus consists of
two complementary components: IGMP and multicast routing protocols </li>
<li>IGMP has only three message types. That are carried within an IP datagram, with an IP protocol number of 2. The membership_query message is sent by a router to all hosts on an attached interface to determine the set of all multicast groups that have been joined by the hosts on that interface.Hosts respond to a membership_query
message with an IGMP membership_report message.</li>
<li>the router infers that a host is no longer in the multicast group if it no longer
responds to a membership_query message with the given group address. This is
an example of what is sometimes called <b>soft state </b> in an Internet protocol.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Multicast routing problem</b>  Hosts joined to the mul-
ticast group are shaded in color; their immediately attached router is also shaded in
color. As shown below, only a subset of routers actually needs to receive the multicast traffic. In  only routers A, B, E, and F need to receive the multicast traffic. Since none of the hosts attached to router D are joined to the multicast group and since router C has no attached hosts, neither C nor D needs to receive the multicast group traffic. <b>The goal of multicast routing, then, is to find a tree of links that connects all of the routers that have attached hosts belonging to the multicast group.</b> </li>

<li>Two approaches have been adopted for determining the multicast
routing tree</li><ul>
<li><b>Multicast routing using a group-shared tree</b>:a center-based approach is used to construct the multicast routing tree, with  edge  routers  with  attached  hosts belonging  to  the  multicast  group sending oin messages addressed to the center node</li>
<li><b>Multicast routing using a source-based tree </b>:The second approach constructs a multicast routing tree for each source in the multicast group. In practice, an RPF algorithm (with source node x) is used to construct  a  multicast  forwarding  tree  for  multicast  datagrams  originating  at source x. The solution to the problem of receiving unwanted multicast  packets  under  RPF  is  known  as  <b>pruning</b>. A  multicast  router that receives multicast packets and has no attached hosts joined to that group will send a prune message to its upstream router</li></ul>
