        (Oct 4)Networks Under Attack
    	</h1>
	<ul> 
   		<li>Malware: stuff that can infect our devices</li>
		<li>Botnet: a compromised network</li>
		<li>Self-Replicating: once in one host it trys to infect others then from there it tries to infrect more hosts ect.</li>
		<li>Viruses: malware that require some form of user interaction to infect the users devices</li>
		<li>Worms: a self-replicating malware that can enter a device without anyt explict user interaction</li>
		<li>denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: renders a network, host or other infrastruture unuseable to legitimate users/</li> 
			<ul>
			<li>Vulnerability attack: involves sending a few well crafted messages to a vunerable application or operating system running on target host. If the right sequence of packets is sent to said appolication or operating system then the servies can stop or worse crash.</li>
			<li>Vulnerability attack:a  deluge  of  packets is sent to  the targeted host (so many packets) that the targetâ€™s access link becomes clogged, preventing legitimate packets from reaching the server</li>
			<li>Connection flooding: establishes a large number of half-open or fully open TCP connections at target host. So the target becomes so over worked that it stops accepting real work. </li>
			</ul>
		<li>Distributed DoS (DDoS): many sources each blast with the faulty messages. it is used as a way to get around the servers decteing all the faulty messages going throught just one server.</li>
		<li>Packet sniffer: records a copy of evey packet that files </li>
		<li>IP spoofing: false source addressing to pretend to be a nice source </li>
	</ul>
