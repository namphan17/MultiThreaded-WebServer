	<ul> 
   	<li>Directory of the Internet</li>
	<li>send requests of either a URL or a IP Address and it will give you the opposite.</li>
	<li>sent with UDP</li>
	<li>Root DNS: severs the interent has 13 across the globe but many little ones all over the place</li>
	<li> Top level domain servers only handle the important domains such as .com, .org and other main .____ domains.</li>
<li>Authoritative DNS servers:  Every organization with publicly accessible hosts on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses
</li>
	<li> main issues</li>
<ul>
<li>Traffic volume: is prone to DoSS attacks</li>
<li>opportunity for single point failure (if system only has one): if this goes down no one can connect to anything </li>
<li>distance centralized database: another reason to have lots around the place because then it is closer to each client.</li>
</ul>
	<li> Can be made both <b> recursive queries and iterative queries </b> </li>
<li> DNS caching: vitally important in terms of speed, keeps a record of the main queries so that it is faster to get to them</li>
	</ul>
