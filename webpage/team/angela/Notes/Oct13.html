	<h2>4.1.1 Forwarding and Routing</h2>
	<ul> 
<li> <i>The terms forwarding and routing are often used interchangeably by authors discussing the network layer but the book uses speific meanings:</i></li>
<ul>
<li>Forwarding: refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link -- interface to the appropriate output link interface When a packet arrives at a router&lsquo;s input link, the router must move the packet to the appropriate output link</li>
<li>Routing:refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination.--The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths are referred to as routing algorithms</li>
</ul>
<li> Every router has a <b>forwarding table</b> meaning that the router forwards by examining the value of a field in the arriving packet&lsquo;s header, and then using this header value to index into the router&lsquo;s forwarding table. The value stored in the forwarding table entry for that header indicates the router&lsquo;s outgoing link interface to which that packet is to be forwarded</li>
<li>Two other terms that are often used interchangeably but wont be here are:packet switch(to  mean  a  general  packet-switching  device  that  transfers  a packet from input link interface to output link interface, according to the value in a field in the header of the packet) and routers( base their forwarding decision on the value in the network-layer field)</li>
<li>third important network-layer function <b>connection setup</b> three-way handshake this allows the sender and receiver to set up the needed state information</li>
