         <b>(Oct 5)Network Application--Transport Services Available to Applications</b>
    	</h1>
	<ul> 
   	<li>Reliable Data Transfer: a protocal provides a guaranteed data delivery service meaning it is delivered correctly and completely to the other end of the application.</li>
	<li>Loss-Tolerant Application: self-explanitory really but they are mostly multimedia applications audio/video because losses may result in small glichs but not crucialy impaire</li>
	<li>Bandwith-Sensitive Applications: Applications that have throughput
requirements  </li>
	<li>Elastic Applications: can make use of as much, or as little, throughput 
as happens to be available</li>
	<li>Timing: transport protocol can provide timing guarantees. This has great variance. It appeals to real time applications. </li>
	<li>Security: transport protocol can provide application with one or more security services. Including data integrity and endpoint authentication. </li>
