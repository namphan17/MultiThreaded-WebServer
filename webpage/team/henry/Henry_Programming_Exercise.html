    <h3 class="headers">Distance Vector Routing Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
        Distance Vector algorithms do exactly what they say on the box.  They work in weighted graphs 
        of nodes and edges to find the most efficient path between all nodes on the network.  They are 
        exhaustive, and have three key features:
    </p>
    <p>DV algorithms are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Iterative: The algorithm runs until all neighbors have exchanged all pertinent information
        </li>
        <li>
            Asynchronous: Not all nodes will perform operations in lockstep with one another.
        </li>
        <li>
            Distributed: Each node gets information from its neighbor or neighbors.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        In a DV algorithm, each node maintain a set of information to update and send to its neighbors.  
        The information is:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For each neighbor vertex (v), the cost (c(x, v)) to get from itself (x) to the each directly attached neighbor v.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dx: the estimated cost to get to all destinations (y), in N.  This is the node's distance vector.
        </li>
        <li>
            The distance vectors of all its direct neighbors.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The Bellman Ford Least Cost Path runs as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        d<sub>x</sub> (y) = min<sub>v</sub>{c(x, v) + dv (y)}
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            d<sub>x</sub> (y) is the value of the least cost path from the current node to the target node (x to y).
        </li>
        <li>
            min<sub>v</sub> represents a minimum distance between the current node and one of its direct neighbors.
        </li>
        <li>
            Based on these components, the least cost path to get from the current node x to the destination node y 
            will be represented by c(x, v) + dv (y).
        </li>
    </ul>
