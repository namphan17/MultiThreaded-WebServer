  \item A shared communications channel has a bandwidth of 3 Mbps.
    Each subscriber requires a bandwidth of 150 kbps when
    using the channel.
    Each subscriber uses the channel only 10\% of the time.

    This means that the capacity of the channel is sufficient to
    allow simultaneous communications by $20$ subscribers.

    This means that the probability $p$ that any given subscriber is active at any given moment
    is $0.1$.

    The probability that exactly $n$ of $N$ subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    when the probability that any individual subscriber is communicating is $p$ is:

    \begin{align*}
      P_{p} (n \mid N ) & = \frac{N!}{n! (N - n)!} (p)^n (1.0 - p)^{N - n}
      \end{align*}

    The probability that exactly n of 120 subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    is\ldots

    \begin{align*}
      P_{0.1} (n \mid 120 ) & = \frac{120!}{n! (120 - n)!} (0.1)^n (1.0 - 0.1)^{120 - n}
      \end{align*}

    With the help of a \href{http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx}{calculator}
    we can find the probability that $21$ or more
    subscribers are active at once.
  
    The online calculator displays input fields for ``Probability of success on a single trial,''
    ``Number of trials,'' and ``Number of successes (x).''
    Enter values of $0.1$, $120$, and $21$ in these fields
    Click on the calculate button.
    Look for the probability that $21$ or more subscribers are simultaneously active
    in the output field that is labeled ``Cumulative probability: $P(X \ge 21)$.''

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that at any given moment
        $21$ or more subscribers will be communicating?
      \item What happens in a packet switched network when subscribers
        request more bandwidth than the channel can provide.
      \item What can you infer from this result about an advantage
        of packet switched communications?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a 0.0079411 probability that 21 or more subscribers will be communicating at any given time.
    \item This results in queueing delays.
    \item Packet switch networks are more economical because of their ability to allow users to share resources by scaling the the allocation of resources based on the current workload.

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How many bits are in an IPv4 address?

    \item If all bits in an IPv4 address were available for specifying
      addresses of different machines on the Internet, how many hosts
      could the Internet connect?

    \item The dotted decimal notation is a way of writing IPv4 addresses.
      
      Find the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ by typing:

      \verb+nslookup www.eonsahead.com+

      Express the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ in
      dotted decimal notation.?

    \item The dotted decimal notation presents an address as
      four decimal numbers, each in the range of $0$ to $255$,
      and separated from one another by periods.

      A number $x$ in the range of $0$ to $255$ can be expressed
      in hexadecimal notation with two hexadecimal digits.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first (most significant) digit is $x / 16$.
        The division is integer division.

      \item The second (least significant) digit is $x \bmod 16$.

      \item Here is an example: $77_{10} \equiv 4D$ because\ldots
      \begin{itemize}
        \item  $77 / 16 = 4$
        \item $77 \bmod 16 = 13$
        \item the hexadecimal digit that represents $13$ is $D$
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{tabular}{ll|ll}
      \textbf{decimal} & \textbf{hexadecimal} & \textbf{decimial} & \textbf{hexadecmal} \\ \hline

      \end{itemize}

      Express the address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ in hexadecimal
      notation.

    \item To translate a number from hexadecimal format to binary,
      replace each hexadecimal digit with the corresponding
      four bits bound in this table:

      \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \textbf{Hexadecimal digit} & \textbf{Binary equivalent} \\ \hline
        0 & 0000 \\
        1 & 0001 \\

      notation.
 
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 32 bits in an IPv4 address.
    \item 2^32 bits in an address gives 4,294,967,296 distinct addresses.
    \item eonsahead.com written in decimal is 45.40.136.115.
    \item eonsahead.com written in decimal is 2D.28.88.73.
    \item Converted from hexadecimal the binary address is 00101101.00101000.10001000.01110011.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item An IPv6 address contains 128 bits. With 128 bits, it
    is possible to represent $2^{128}$ addresses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Look up the current population of the earth. What integer
      power of two most closely approximates this number?
    \item What is the integer power of ten that most closely
      approximates $2^{128}$?

      Here are some relationships that you might find helpful.

      \begin{align*}
        2^{10} & \approx 1000 = 10^3 \\
        2^{20} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^6 \\
        2^{30} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^9 \\
        2^{40} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx
            10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^{12}
        \end{align*}

      In general, if $2^x = 10^y$, then $y$ is approximately equal to $x/y$: $2^{40} \approx 10^{40/3}$.
      
    \item How many IPv6 addresses would each person on earth have if the addresses
      were evenly distributed?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item With a little over 7 billion people estimated on this planet, we would need 2^33 to give each their own unique number.
    \item 2^128 is most close to 3.4 x 10^38.
    \item 3.4 x 10^38 / 7 billion = 4.85 x 10^28 addresses per person.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Hundreds of millions of IPv4 addresses are reserved.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item For what purposes are the CIDR address blocks 10.0.0.0/8 and 192.168.0.0/16 reserved?
    \item How many addresses are in the 10.0.0.0/8 block?
    \item How many addresses are in the 192.168.0.0/16?
    \item Use the \verb+ifconfig+ command to determine the IP address of
      one of the Linux machines in our laboratory. What is the address of the computer?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item These CIDR blocks of addresses are reserved for private networks.  This allows partitions and communication between devices on the private network.
    \item 16,777,216 addresses.
    \item 65,536 addresses.
    \item 10.101.6.5 is the address of this particular machine.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Port numbers are $16$ bit addresses. A $16$ bit address is large
    enough to specify any one of $65536$ different ports. What is a programmer
    addressing when a programmer specifies a port number?

  \begin{answer}
    When declaring a port number, we are giving instructions as to which port the application that is receiving the data is listening on.  Applications have software features called sockets which 
   are capable of assigning the application to a port at the operating system level, giving them access to the network hardware on the machine.
    \end{answer}

  \item Here is an address: d4:9a:20:0a:49:00
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The format of this address matches the format of what kind of address?
    \item What does the address identify?
    \item The address contains 12 hexadecimal digits. How many bits are needed
      to specify this kind of address?
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item This is a MAC address.
    \item MAC addresses give a kind of serial number to the network hardware on the machine.  This includes a manufacturer identification, followed by a unique identifier for the unit.
    \item MAC address are 6 bytes, 48 bits, long.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item What kinds of addresses to the headers in each of these kinds
      of packets contain? (Your choices are IP addresses, MAC addresses,
      and port numbers.)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Transport layer segments
    \item Network layer datagrams
    \item Link layer Ethernet frames
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Port numbers.
    \item IP addresses.
    \item MAC addresses.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item DHCP is a client-server protocol.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What does this service provide to clients? (It may provide more than one item.) 
    \item Under what circumstances is a DHCP service especially useful?
    \item Which transport level protocol and which port number is used by
      a host to discover a DHCP server?
    \item DHCP uses an IP address that is reserved for broadcast. 
      A host that joins a network is a client.
      The exchange between a DHCP client and a DHCP server begins when
      the client broadcasts a \emph{discover message}.
      The client broadcasts this message because it does not yet know
      any addresses (including most particularly the address of the DHCP
      server) in the network.
      The server responds by broadcasting an \emph{offer message}.

      Why does the server also broadcast the \emph{offer message}?

    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol and it is a meta network tool which provides a host with its network ID information such as its IP address and connection configuration.
    \item Without DHCP the process of assigning IP addresses to new machines or addresses a newly accessed subnet would require manual configuration.  It would be very tedious.
    \item DHCP uses UDP and the server uses port 67 while the client-side uses port 68.
    \item The server can not target the new machine specifically because it does not have its communication specifications yet.  It can only listen to the broadcast channel.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item What are several possible objections to the use of NAT?

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item NAT does not provide the level of information infrastructure that many of our applications now require with regard to IP addresses.
    \item NAT adds a great deal of complexity to our current networking models.
    \item NAT is a quick fix patch to the issue of IPv4 exhaustion, it is not a new paradigm.
    \item NAT does not provide the true end to end connection that real time or streaming applications require.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item DNS and ARP both translate between two kinds of addresses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Between which two kinds of addresses does DNS translate?
    \item Between which two kinds of addresses does ARP translate?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item DNS translates between IP addresses that computers can read and hostnames that people can read.
    \item ARP translates between MAC addresses and IP addresses.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) defines a limit at which
      layer of the Internet protocol stack?
    \item The MSS (Maximum Segment Size) defines a limit at which
      layer of the Internet protocol stack?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item MTU operates at the link layer.
    \item MSS operates at the transport layer.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item The link-state algorithm associates a number and a label with
    each node in a network. The algorithm assigns an initial value
    of $\infty$ to the number and $NULL$ (unknown) to the label.
    It updates these values in the course of its execution.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What does the number denote?
    \item What does the label denote?
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{answer}

    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item The Bellman-Ford equation describes a relationship that
    is the basis of the distance-vector routing algorithm.

    Combine the following mathematical expressions
    (found in the first column of the table) to produce the Bellman-Ford equation.

    $\{ \cdots \}$ & a set \\
    ${\min}_v$ & \parbox[t]{10cm}{minimum value in collection of values that
      depend upon $v$, for all values of $v$}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is inter-AS routing?
    \item Is scalability a more important concern in intra-AS routing
      or in inter-AS routing?
    \item Is performance (for example, the selection of the shortest
      route) a more important concern in intra-AS routing or
      in inter-AS routing?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item This specificies an Inter-Domain routing protocol between two networks.  These protocols are usually Autonomous Systems (AS).

  \item In the following table, the first four elements of the
    first four rows are data. The fifth element in each of the 
    first four rows is a parity bit computed for that row.
    The elements of the fifth row are parity bits computed
    for the columns.

    The parity bits have been chosen to make the number of
    ones in a row (or column) even.
    For example, only one of the data bits in the first row
    is a one. Making the parity bit a one makes the total
    number of ones in the row even.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What can the receiver know?
      \item What can the receiver do?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The receiver knows that there is the possibility of an error based on the arithmetic not adding up.
    \item The receiver would request a retransmission of the suspected corrupted packet.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item This problem is about a CSMA/CD network.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $d_{prog}$ be the upper bound on the time required
      for front edge of a signal to travel (propagate) between two network adapters (interfaces).
    \item Let $d_{tran}$ be the time required to transmit the largest frame.
    \item Let $E$ be the efficiency of the network. ``Efficiency'' means the
      fraction of time (computed over a long run) in which frames are passing
      between adapters without collision. Assume that there are many adapters
      with many frames to send.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{align*}
    E & \approx \frac{1}{1 + 5 \cdot \frac{d_{prog}}{d_{tran}}}
    \end{align*}

    Here is an analogy: Imagine a large school. There are many rooms.
    A single hallway connects the rooms. At unpredictable times, groups of students in
    one room pass through the hall to another room. A group of art
    students might move from the studio to the library. Another group of
    students might later move from the chemistry laboratory to the gymnasium.
    After that, a third group of students might walk from their English class to
    the nurse's office.

    A rule forbids more than one group of students to be in the hall at once.
    If the chemistry students open the door and see the art students in the hall,
    they must duck back into their laboratory, check the hallway for traffic
    again at a later time, and proceed only when the see at that the hallway
    is empty.

    In this case, $d_{prog}$ is a measure of how fast the students walk,
    and $d_{tran}$ is a measure of how much time it takes to get a group
    of students through a classroom door into the hall.
    The amount of time that a group spends in the hall is a function
    both of how fast the students walk and how many students are in the
    group.

    Efficiency is the fraction of time during which there are students
    in the hallway moving between rooms.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{prog}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{tran}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $E$ increases when $d_{prog}$ is decreased.
    \item $E$ increases when $d_{tran}$ is increased.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Both routers and switchs store and forward packets.
    Routers execute layer 3 protocols. In layer 3, IP addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Switches execute layer 2 protocols. In layer 2, MAC addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Even so, network administrators can often choose to connect two networks
    using a router instead of a switch (or vice versa). 
    Network adminstrators need to know the advantages and disadvantages of
    each kind of device.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Hierarchical addressing and an easier avoidance of cycles (an attractive characteristic)
      is a property of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item ``Plug-and-play'' (an attractive characteristic) is a property of which
      kind of device: router or switch?
    \item Faster processing of packets (an attractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item The option of choosing from a greater variety of topologies (an attractive characteristic)
      follows from the selection of which kind of device: routers or switches?
      A greater variety of topologies means freedom from the constraint of avoiding multiple links
      between elements in a network. The network need not be a spanning tree, but can be a more
      general kind of graph.
    \item Susceptibilty to broadcast storms (an unattractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A router.
    \item A switch.
    \item Switches are faster because they have a simpler architecture, but this gives them less functionality.
    \item A router.
    \item A switch.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The computation is a long division. As in any long division, the computation
      requires subtractions of multiples of the divisor. How does the method of subtraction
      differs from ordinary subtraction? 
    \item What is the bit string that the sender will transmit?
    \item What kinds of errors can the receiver detect?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item We do not borrow from the next digit.  Because the quotient is disregarded, we borrow from "infinity".
    \item CRC-enabled devices calculate a check sequence, a short binary sequence which is appended to each block of data.
    \item CRCs are a quick and cheap way to provide a reasonable level of assurance that data has not been corrupted by a network error.  They do not protect against the intentional manipulation of data.
