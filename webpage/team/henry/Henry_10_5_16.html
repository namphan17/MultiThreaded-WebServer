    <h4 id="Page Header">Network Application Architecture</h4>

    <p>There are two main structures used to allow applications running on different
    hosts to communicate over a network.  The two architectures are client-server and
    peer to peer, or P2P.</p>

    <h5>Client-Server Model</h5>

    <p>In the client server model, there is a central machine called the server which
    "serves" things to other machines in the network.  These items are typically
    documents; web pages.</p>

    <p>This model allows users to send and recieve data across the network simply by 
    downloading and uploading items to the central sever(s).</p>

    <table>
        <thead>Pros and Cons of Client-Server</thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Anonymity</td>
            <td>Server must always be up</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Only need the address of the server</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>More Secure</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>A client-server network is usually more secure because </p>

    <h5>Peer to Peer Model</h5>

    <p>In the peer to peer model, each user in the network must establish an individual 
    connection to each other user.  This type of connection is useful when real-time 
    data streaming is important, such as in a multiplayer game.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>Pros and Cons of Peer to Peer</thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Pros</th>
            <th>Cons</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>No critical central connection</td>
            <td>Loss of anonymity</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Direct connection to other end users</td>
            <td>Requires address of every user in the network</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Harder to secure more individual connections</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>In my own experience, P2P connections are mostly used now for playing online games.  
    This type of connection allows for less delay because there are no intermediary links
    for the data to traverse.</p>
