                    Q:  What are the different types of delay at a node in a packet-switch network?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A node in a packet-switch network may suffer from processing, queuing, transmission, and
                    propogation delays together make up what is called total nodal delay.

                <p>
                    Q:  What is meant by the phrase "A Network of Networks"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  This is part of our theme of layers of abstraction.  There are routers and communication
                    links which span the entire globe, and this in itself is a network.  However, there is not
                    one single ISP which manages this entire global network.  Instead, ISPs charge and segment
                    networks on an individual basis, or sometimes in small chunks of routers.  These are each networks
                    as well, and we therefore call this system a network of interconnected networks.

                    Q:  In our context, what is a protocol?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
                    two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission
                    and/or receipt of a message or other event.

                <p>
                    Q:  Please name the two network application architectures and give one advantage of each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The two architectures are client-server and peer to peer or P2P.  Client-server models
                    have many advantages, the primary one being a simple structure which allows end users to
                    access the entire network by connecting solely to the central server, providing ease of access
                    as well as relative security.  Peer to peer has the advantage of a direct connection to other
                    users, so that the network connections are not dependent on a single point of failure.

            <li id="question5">
                <p>
                    Q:  For what kind of application is it critical to have low delay, and for what kind is it not
                    ciritical for low delays, but desirable for high throughput?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Internet telephony, video calling, and gaming requires low delay because the real-time information
                    is critical.  For file transfering it is not critical to have low delays, but it is desirable
                    to have high throughput to get the entire file quickly.

            <li id="question6">
               <p>
                   Q:  What is the relationship between a socket and a port?  What are the well known port numbers?
               </p>
                <p>
                    A:  In the context of this course a socket is an application level software component that allows 
                    the application to transmit and receive data, and a port is an endpoint on a network which is defined 
                    at an operating system level.  A socket on an application is designated a port number, allowing the 
                    computer to porperly deliver data from the network to the correct process on the local machine.<br/>

                    <b>P26 from Chapter 2.  Page 177</b> Suppose Bob joins a BitTorrent torrent, but he does not 
                    want to upload any data to any other peers (so called free-riding).<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Bob claims that he can receive a complete copy of the file 
                    that is shared by the swarm. Is Bob’s claim possible? Why or why not?<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Bob further claims that he can further make his “free-riding” more efficient
                    by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP
                    addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer to part A:  Bob's claim is possible.  There is nothing inherent in the peer-to-peer architecture 
                    to prevent someone from "free-riding".  For a time BitTorrent's primary weakness was its reliance on a base 
                    of altruistic users.  Because of the legal gray area that file sharing services represent, some users are 
                    reluctant to expose themselves by sharing parts of files themselves and instead stick strictly to downloading.    
                    As recently as five years ago, BitTorrent has been implementing reward systems for users who have a good record 
                    of contributing to the community, punishing those who take advantage of the services it has to offer.
                </p>
        <p>
            Answer to part B:  Bob could make his file harvesting more efficient by using multiple computers.  Consider the answer to 
            part A which demonstrates that BitTorrent uses a reward system to prevent users from downloading files without contributing themselves.  
            There is nothing to stop Bob from sharing the same piece of a file from multiple different computers, wile using those distinct computers to 
            download distinct portions of a file.  This would allow Bob to gain more file fragments per shared fragment, proportional to the number of computers 
            Bob was able to use.
        </p>
                <p>
                    <b>P26 from Chapter 3. Page 293</b>Consider transferring an enormous file of L bytes from Host A to Host B.
                    Assume an MSS of 536 bytes.<br /><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. What is the maximum value of L such that TCP sequence numbers are not
                    exhausted? Recall that the TCP sequence number field has 4 bytes.<br /><br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. For the L you obtain in (a), find how long it takes to transmit the file.
                    Assume that a total of 66 bytes of transport, network, and data-link header
                    are added to each segment before the resulting packet is sent out over a
                    155 Mbps link. Ignore flow control and congestion control so A can pump
                    out the segments back to back and continuously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Answer to Part A:  If the Maximum Segment Size is 536 bytes, and the TCP sequence flag requires 4 bytes, then the 
                    maximum amount of data in each TCP segment is 536 - 4 = 532 bytes.  Since the sequence number is alloted 4 bytes, 
                    there can be 2 ^ 32 or 4,294,967,295 distinct segments in the file.  This means that the maximum size of L is 
                    (2 ^ 32) x 532 bytes = 2.284 terabytes.
                </p>
        <p>
            Answer to Part B:  On a 155 Mbps network, ignoring flow and congestion control, this download should take 2,464.1 hours.  
            Around 100 days.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q: What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer to transfer the
                    file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is the IP address and port number used by gaia.cs.umass.edu to 
                    receive the file?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A: The source computer's IP address is 10.128.6.4 and the TCP port number is 4444.  The destination 
                    computer's IP address is 128.119.245.12 and it uses port 80.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection 
                    between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu?  What is it in the segment that identifies the 
                    segment as a SYN segment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number of the TCP SYN segment is the value used to intitiate the TCP handshake between 
                    the two computers.  The value is 0.  The SYN flag has a value of 1 which is what denotes that this 
                    is a SYN segment.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer 
                    in reply to the SYN?  What is the value of the ACKnowledgement field in the SYNACK segment?  How did 
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a 
                    SYNACK segment?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number in reply to the SYN is 0.  The ACK value in the SYNACK segment is 1.  The 
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu computer adds 1 to the initial field in the SYNACK segment from the client computer 
                    to achieve the SYNACK segment flags.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:  What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command?  Note that 
                    in order to find the POST command, you'll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom 
                    of the Wireshark window, looking for a segment with a "POST" within its DATA field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The sequence number of the segment containing the HTTP POST command is 1.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Q:   Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first
                    segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six
                    segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP
                    POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each
                    segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was
                    sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each
                    of the six segments? What is the EstimatedRTT value (see page 237 in text)
                    after the receipt of each ACK? Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is
                    equal to the measured RTT for the first segment, and then is computed using the
                    EstimatedRTT equation on page 249 for all subsequent segments.<br/><br/>
                    Note: Wireshark has a nice feature that allows you to plot the RTT for
                    each of the TCP segments sent. Select a TCP segment in the “listing of
                    captured packets” window that is being sent from the client to the
                    gaia.cs.umass.edu server. Then select: Statistics->TCP Stream Graph-
                    >Round Trip Time Graph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The HTTP POST segment is the first segment.  The sequence numbers for segments 1-6 are 
                    1, 566, 2026, 3486, 4946, and 6406, respectively.  The sending and receiving times can be listed as
