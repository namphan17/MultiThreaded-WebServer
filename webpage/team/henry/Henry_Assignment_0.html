                <p>
                    Q:  What are the two overlaying protocols that control the sending and receiving
                    of information on the internet?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question2">
                <p>
                    Q:  What are distributed applications and why are they considered distributed?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Distrubted applications are applications which run on end systems.  That is
                    to say, these applications run on separate hosts and use the internet to send and
                    receive data with applications running on other remote host machines.  They are
                    therefore considered distributed because they communicate across a network as opposed
                    to internally with applications on the same machine.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question3">
                <p>
                    Q:  In our context, what is a protocol?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between
                    two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission
                    and/or receipt of a message or other event.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question4">
                <p>
                    Q:  Name three physical mediums for transmitting data on the internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Possibilities: Fiber Optic Cable, Coaxial Cable, Twisted Pair Copper Wire (Insulated
                    and Unshielded), Satellite Radio Channels, Terrestrial Radio Channels.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question5">
                <p>
                    Q:  What is meant by the phrase "A Network of Networks"?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  This is part of our theme of layers of abstraction.  There are routers and communication
                    links which span the entire globe, and this in itself is a network.  However, there is not
                    one single ISP which manages this entire global network.  Instead, ISPs charge and segment
                    networks on an individual basis, or sometimes in small chunks of routers.  These are each networks
                    as well, and we therefore call this system a network of interconnected networks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question6">
                <p>
                    Q:  What are the different types of delay at a node in a packet-switch network?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  A node in a packet-switch network may suffer from processing, queuing, transmission, and
                    propogation delays together make up what is called total nodal delay.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question7">
                <p>
                    Q:  For what kind of application is it critical to have low delay, and for what kind is it not
                    ciritical for low delays, but desirable for high throughput?
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  Internet telephony, video calling, and gaming requires low delay because the real-time information
                    is critical.  For file transfering it is not critical to have low delays, but it is desirable
                    to have high throughput to get the entire file quickly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li id="question8">
                <p>
                    Q:  Please name the two network application architectures and give one advantage of each.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A:  The two architectures are client-server and peer to peer or P2P.  Client-server models
                    have many advantages, the primary one being a simple structure which allows end users to
                    access the entire network by connecting solely to the central server, providing ease of access
                    as well as relative security.  Peer to peer has the advantage of a direct connection to other
                    users, so that the network connections are not dependent on a single point of failure.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Kleinrock is an important American computer 
            scientist who, among other things, worked very closely with the development of the first 
            pieces of hardware that comprised the internet in the early days.&nbsp;&nbsp;He graduated from 
            MIT with a doctorate in computer science in 1963, and then joined the faculty at UCLA where he 
            remains today.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleirock's most recognized and significant work was 
            done on queuing theory, which is instrumental to packet switching and in turn the concepts of 
            computer networks that we are learning about in this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;In his PhD research 
            Kleinrock describes his work as being to, "establish a mathematical theory of packet networks...".
            &nbsp;&nbsp;This work would become critical not only in his work at MIT on the first ARPANET 
            message, but also for the operation of the world wide web today.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw in the movie "Lo and Behold" the machine that 
            Charley Kline used to send the first message on October 29th, 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;Kleinrock oversaw this 
            operation and after the first system crash the system was recovered and a month later the first 
            permanent ARPANET link between Stanford and MIT was established.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Kleinrock has since made a number of contributions 
            to the bureaucratic acceptance of the use of the internet for personal reasons, and was inducted into 
            the Internet Hall of Fame in 2012, among receiving a number of other nationally significant awards.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;These include the National Medal of Science, which he received in 2008, and an induction into IEEE-Eta 
            Kappa Nu in 2011.  This man has lead an incredible life, and his work has undoubtedly help shape the 
            landscape of modern society.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub is a version control software application which can be accessed both as a web application or 
            a desktop application.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that it is very useful for teams of individuals who are working 
            in parallel on a project who need a way to keep track of changes that are made to the project or authorship 
            of individual portions of the work.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get started with GitHub you will need to create an account.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;This process is quite simple and can be done at github.com by filling out the sign-up form.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you have an account, we can learn about repositories.&nbsp;&nbsp;Repositories are the way that 
            GitHub delineates different projects or packages of files.&nbsp;&nbsp;A repository has branches and is created with 
            a single master branch which represents the official project.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of branches is to allow users who 
            are working on the project to create new branches of the project where they can experiment with making changes 
            without affecting the integrity of the master branch; the official project.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating branches is as simple as the click of a button, and 
            requires only that you name the branch and give a brief description of its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only 
            tricky part of operating with these different branches is the push and pull functionality, along with the 
            ability to clone branches.&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub stores its data in a cloud, on a remote server.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you "pull" 
            a branch off of the master branch, it does not create a physical copy of the files on your machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do 
            this, you will need to "clone" the project, or download it to your local machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can then make changes 
            to those files as you see fit.<br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key to getting your changes incorporated into the master branch 
            involve "committing" your changes to your own branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;GitHub will automatically track the differences between 
            your version of the files in the project, and those of your branch and the master branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once changes have been 
            made, you can click on the "commit" button, merely give a description of the changes you made, and they will 
            become the new version of your branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are ready to make your changes part of the master branch, you will 
            create a "pull request"  which is the same as a commit except that the administrator of the project will have to 
            approve the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once they do, your changes will become part of the master project.&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations, you 
            can now perform basic operations in GitHub!
