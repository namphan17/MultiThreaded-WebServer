<br>
<b>Per-Connection Throughput</b> - number of bytes per second at the reciever.<br>
<b>Offerred Load</b> - Rate at which the transport layer sends segments into the network.<br>
<b>Choke Packet</b> - Single bit denoting a router is congested.<br>
<b>Resource Management Cells</b> - Convey congestion-related information among hosts and switches.<br>
<b>Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) Bit</b> - Single bit in all data cells that indicates congestion.<br>
<b>No Increase (NI) Bit</b> - For mild congestion; don't increase data flow.<br>
<b>Explicit Rate (ER) Field</b> - 2-bit value that denotes the minimum supportable rate on all switches in source-destination path.<br>
<b>Congestion Window (CWND)</b> - Amount of unacknowledged data may not exceed <i>min(cwnd,rwnd)</i>.<br>
<b>Self-Checking</b> - TCP uses acks to trigger its increase in congested window size.<br>
<b>TCP Congestion Control Algorithm</b> - Slow start, congestion avoidance, fast recovery.<br>
TCP's congestion control is known as an <b>Additive-Increase Multiplicative-Decrease (AIMD)</b> form of congestion control.<br>
