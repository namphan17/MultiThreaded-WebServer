<h1>Vint Cerf</h1>
<h3>The Father of the Internet</h3>
</center>
<p>
Born in New Haven, Coneticut as Vinton Gray Cerf on June 23rd, 1943, 
Vint is a very well-dressed pioneer of the internet. 
Coined by many as one of the "fathers of the internet",
Vint, along with Robert Kahn, created the TCP/IP Protocol which is still widely used today.
</p>
<p>
Vint started out with a Bachelor Degree of Science in Mathematics from
Stanford University when he went to work as a systems engineer at IBM. 
After working for 2 years, Vint went to the University of California Los Angelos to
get his Masters, then Doctorate, degree in Computer Science. While at UCLA, Vint 
worked with a group of people who together created the first two nodes of the Internet's
predecessor, the ARPAnet. After gaining his doctorate, Vint went back to Stanford University,
where he became an assistant professor to research network connections. While he was there,
he met Robert Kahn. Together, Vint and Robert designed the TCP/IP protocol for the 
United States Department of Defense. At this point, Vint moved to the 
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, another agency of the United States Government. 
After a couple years, he moved to MCI Communications to serve as Vice President, and
oversee the development of the first e-mail system, MCI Mail.
</p>
<p>
In 1998, Vint assisted in the foundation of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers,
which is a nonprofit organization that manages the root DNS servers among other services
related to internet namespaces. One year later, Vint joined ICANN as a member of the board.
In November 2000, he was elected as chairman of the ICANN board, where he remained for 7 years
before resigning in November 2007. 
</p>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Google as Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist</li>
<li>The Broadband Comission for Digital Development as Comissioner</li>
