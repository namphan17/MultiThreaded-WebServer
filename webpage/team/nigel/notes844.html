<h1> Notes 8.4.4</h1>

<br>
<b>Media Access Control (MAC) Address</b> - A hardware address given to any network adapter hardware.<br>
<b>Address Resolution Protocol</b> - Translate between MAC and IP addresses.<br>
<b>ARP Table</b> - A mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses.<br>
<b>ARP Packet</b> - A packet containing the sending and receiving IP and MAC addresses.<br>
<b>Hub</b> - Retransmits a received bit to all connected hosts.<br>
<b>Switch</b> - A collision-less solution to hubs that only retransmits a bit to its intended destination.<br>
Fields of the ethernet frame:
<ul>
<li><u>Data Field</u> - This field carries the IP datagram. The maximum
transmission unit (MTU) of Ethernet is 1,500 bytes. This means that if the IP
datagram exceeds 1,500 bytes, then the host has to fragment the datagram, as discussed
in Section 4.4.1. The minimum size of the data field is 46 bytes. This
means that if the IP datagram is less than 46 bytes, the data field has to be
"stuffed" to fill it out to 46 bytes. When stuffing is used, the data passed to the
network layer contains the stuffing as well as an IP datagram. The network layer
uses the length field in the IP datagram header to remove the stuffing.</li>
<li><u>Destination Address</u> - This field contains the MAC address of the destination
adapter, BB-BB-BB-BB-BB-BB. When adapter B receives an Ethernet
frame whose destination address is either BB-BB-BB-BB-BB-BB or the
MAC broadcast address, it passes the contents of the frame's data field to the
network layer; if it receives a frame with any other MAC address, it discards
the frame.</li>
<li><u>Source Address</u> - This field contains the MAC address of the adapter that
transmits the frame onto the LAN, in this example, AA-AA-AA-AA-AA-AA.</li>
<li><u>Type Field</u> - The type field permits Ethernet to multiplex network-layer
protocols. To understand this, we need to keep in mind that hosts can use other
network-layer protocols besides IP. In fact, a given host may support multiple network-layer protocols using different protocols for different applications. For
this reason, when the Ethernet frame arrives at adapter B, adapter B needs to
know to which network-layer protocol it should pass (that is, demultiplex) the
contents of the data field. IP and other network-layer protocols (for example,
Novell IPX or AppleTalk) each have their own, standardized type number. Furthermore,
the ARP protocol (discussed in the previous section) has its own type
number, and if the arriving frame contains an ARP packet (i.e., has a type field
of 0806 hexadecimal), the ARP packet will be demultiplexed up to the ARP protocol.
Note that the type field is analogous to the protocol field in the networklayer
datagram and the port-number fields in the transport-layer segment; all of
these fields serve to glue a protocol at one layer to a protocol at the layer above.</li>
<li><u>Cyclic Redundancy Check</u> - As discussed in Section 5.2.3, the purpose
of the CRC field is to allow the receiving adapter, adapter B, to detect bit
errors in the frame.</li>
<li><u>Preamble</u> - The Ethernet frame begins with an 8-byte preamble field.
Each of the first 7 bytes of the preamble has a value of 10101010; the last byte is
10101011. The first 7 bytes of the preamble serve to "wake up" the receiving
adapters and to synchronize their clocks to that of the sender's clock. Why
should the clocks be out of synchronization? Keep in mind that adapter A aims
to transmit the frame at 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, or 1 Gbps, depending on the type
of Ethernet LAN. However, because nothing is absolutely perfect, adapter A will
not transmit the frame at exactly the target rate; there will always be some drift
from the target rate, a drift which is not known a priori by the other adapters on
the LAN. A receiving adapter can lock onto adapter A's clock simply by locking
onto the bits in the first 7 bytes of the preamble. The last 2 bits of the eighth byte
of the preamble (the first two consecutive 1s) alert adapter B that the "important
stuff" is about to come.</li>
</ul>
Ethernet Standardizations:
<ul>
<li>10BASE-T</li>
<li>10BASE-2</li>
<li>100BASE-T</li>
<li>1000BASE-LX</li>
<li>10GBASE-T</li>
</ul>
<b>Repeater</b> - A physical-layer device that receives a signal and regenerates it as output.<br>
<b>Switch Transparency</b> - A switch is not known to hosts and routers on the subnet.<br>
<b>Filtering</b> - The switch function that determines whether a frame should be forwarded to some interface or just dropped.<br>
<b>Switch Table</b> - Contains entries for some, but not necessarily all, hosts/routers on a LAN. The table holds the Address, Interface, and a Time when it was placed in the table.<br>
Properties:
<ul>
<li><u>Elimination of Collisions</u> - In a LAN built from switches (and without hubs), there
is no wasted bandwidth due to collisions! The switches buffer frames and never
transmit more than one frame on a segment at any one time. As with a router, the
maximum aggregate throughput of a switch is the sum of all the switch interface
rates. Thus, switches provide a significant performance improvement over LANs
with broadcast links.</li>
<li><u>Heterogeneous Links</u> - Because a switch isolates one link from another, the different
links in the LAN can operate at different speeds and can run over different
media. For example, the uppermost switch in Figure 5.22 might have three
1 Gbps 1000BASE-T copper links, two 100 Mbps 100BASE-FX fiber links, and
one 100BASE-T copper link. Thus, a switch is ideal for mixing legacy equipment
with new equipment.</li>
<li><u>Management</u> - In addition to providing enhanced security (see sidebar on Focus
on Security), a switch also eases network management. For example, if an
adapter malfunctions and continually sends Ethernet frames (called a jabbering
adapter), a switch can detect the problem and internally disconnect the malfunctioning
adapter. With this feature, the network administrator need not get
out of bed and drive back to work in order to correct the problem. Similarly, a
cable cut disconnects only that host that was using the cut cable to connect to
the switch. In the days of coaxial cable, many a network manager spent hours
"walking the line" (or more accurately, "crawling the floor") to find the cable
break that brought down the entire network. As discussed in Chapter 9 (Network
Management), switches also gather statistics on bandwidth usage, collision
rates, and traffic types, and make this information available to the network
manager. This information can be used to debug and correct problems, and to
plan how the LAN should evolve in the future. Researchers are exploring adding
yet more management functionality into Ethernet LANs in prototype deployments.</li>
