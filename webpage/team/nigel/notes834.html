<br>
<b>Forwarding</b> - The transfer of a packet from an incoming link from and outgoing link in a single router.<br>
<b>Routing</b> - The transfer of a packet through all of a network's routers.<br>
<b>Routing Algorithms</b> - The algorithms that calculate the route taken by packets through a network.<br>
<b>Forwarding Tables</b> - Internal table in the router that maps the adjacent routers to the router's link interfaces.<br>
<b>Link-Layer Switches</b> - Base their forwarding decision on values in the fields of the link-layer frame.<br>
<b>Routers</b> - Base their forwarding decision on values in the network layer.<br>
<b>Connection Setup</b> - The process of routers handshaking with eachother.<br>
<b>Network Service Model</b> - Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay, In-order packet delivery, Guaranteed minimal bandwidth, Guaranteed maximum jitter, Security services.<br>
<b>Virtual Circuit Network</b> - Only provides a connection service.<br>
<b>Datagram Network</b> - Only provides a connectionless service.<br>
<b>Connection State Information</b> - Info in the memory of the router about the connection.<br>
<b>Signaling Merges</b> - Messages passed between routers to set up the Virtual Connection.<br>
<b>Signaling Protocols</b> - Method in which Signaling Merges are exchanged.<br>
<b>Longest Prefix Matching Rule</b> - Match a packet's destination IP with the longest prefix in its table.<br>
<b>Forwarding Function</b> - The transfer of packets between links in a router.<br>
<b>Router Forwarding Plane</b> - Input ports, Switching fabric, Output ports, Routing processor.<br>
<b>Router Control Plane</b> - Executing routing protocols, responding to attached links, performing management functions.<br>
<b>Packet Loss</b> - When a packets are dropped due to a router's loss of memory.<br>
<b>Packet Scheduler</b> - Selects a packet from those queued for transmission.<br>
<b>Drop-Tail</b> - If there is not enough memory to buffer an incoming packet.<br>
<b>Quality-of-Service Guarantees</b> - Guarantees that service is of quality.<br>
<b>Active Queue Management</b> - Packet-dropping and packet-marking policies.<br>
<b>Random Early Detection</b> - Weighted average is maintained for an output queue, and if the average is > a threshold, packets are dropped.<br>
<b>Head-of-Line Blocking</b> - When a packet in an input queue must wait for transfer through fabris, even though its port is free, because it is blocked by another packet at the head of line.<br>
