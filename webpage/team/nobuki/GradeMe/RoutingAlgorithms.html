        Routing Algorithms
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose of routing is to find a good path to get from point A to point B</li>
        <li><b>Default router/First-hop router: </b> The only router a host is connected to</li>
        <li><b>Source router/Destination router: </b> The default router of a source/destination</li>
        <li>Routing from a source host to a destination host is about routing the source router to the destination router.</li>
        <li>A good path usually is the path with the least cost.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>However, there are “real-world concerns” such as policy issues that prevent requests from certain companies be denied on other company routers.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The cost of an edge typically may reflect the physical length, the link speed, or monetary cost. The textbook will just give the cost, so don’t worry about it.</li>
        <li>The cost of edge (x,y) is represented by c(x, y)</li>
        <li><b>Globalized Routing Algorithm: </b> Each node has information about distance between all nodes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Link-State algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Decentralized Routing Algorithm:</b>Each node only has knowledge on the distance between its neighboring nodes.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Distance Vectoring algorithm</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
