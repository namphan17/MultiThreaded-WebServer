    <h3>
        Parity Check
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>bit-level error detection: </b> detecting the corruption of bits in a linked-layer frame sent from one node to another physically connected neighboring node.</li>
        <li><b>Parity Checks</b>: the simplest form of detection is the use of a single parity bit. </li>
        <li>If the information has D bits, an even parity scheme will send the total number of 1s in the d +1bits.</li>
        <li>An odd scheme will chose a value with an odd number of 1s.</li>
        <li>There is a 50 percent chance method</li>
        <li>one error can easily be canceled out by another error</li>
        <li><b>Two-dimensional parity scheme</b> both the row and column containing the flipped bit will be in error.</li>
        <li>This makes the chance of having an error in the check much lower along with knowing where the error is.</li>
        <li><b>FEC</b> or forwarding error correction is the ability of the receiver to both detect and correct errors.</li>
        <li>Thses techniques are usually used in audio storage or playback devices.</li>
