        Ethernet
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ethernet has taken over the wired LAN market.</li>
        <li>There are many reasons to the Ethernet's success</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It was developed early, so network admins became familiar with the Ethernet.</li>
            <li>Also, its competitors were more complex and expensive than the ethernet.</li>
            <li>For these two reasons, the admins were reluctant to switch over to other ways to set up LAN</li>
            <li>Ethernet had lower data rates than the newere technology, but Ethernet updated itself to keep up with the data rates.</li>
            <li>Switched ethernet was also created.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Bob Metcalfe and David Boggs invented the ethernet in the mid 1970s</li>
        <li>It originally used a coaxial bus to internconnect the nodes, which lasted until the mid 1990s.</li>
        <li>It switched to using a hub, which just recreates bits that arrived on one end and out another.</li>
        <li>In the 2000s the center hub was replaced with a switch that increased the data rates.</li>
        <li>That switch was collision-less and a bona-fide store-and-forward packet switch that only operated through layer 2</li>
        <li>This is different that routers that opperate through layer 3</li>
        <li>Frame structure parts and their size</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Data field 46-1,500 bytes</li>
            <li>Destination address 6 bytes</li>
            <li>Source address 6 bytes</li>
            <li>Type field 2bytes</li>
            <li>Cyclic redundancy check 4 bytes</li>
            <li>Preamble 8 bytes</li>
        </ul>

        
    </ul>
