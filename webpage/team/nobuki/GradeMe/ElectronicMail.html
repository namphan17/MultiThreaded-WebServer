    <h1>Elctronic Mail in the Internet</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>email is asyncronous, which means you don't have to syncronise with other people. You can send and recieve mail when convenient</li>
        <li>There are three major components to the Internet mail system.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>user agents</li>
            <li>mail servers</li>
            <li>SMPT(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>SMPT transfers messages from the sender to the reciever.</li>
                <li>SMPT orignally was from 1982</li>
                <li>SMPT tries to deliver a message to the reciever. If the message is not recieved, it will try again later.</li>
                <li>SMPT has two sides: a client side and a server side.</li>
                <li>the client side sends the messages while the server side recieves the messages</li>
                <li>The SMTP runs on steps. First, the client SMTP establishes a connection at the server SMTP. Then those two perform some application layer handshaking. then the two exchange information such as the email address of both sender and reciever and the message. Then the message is sent.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <li>There are differences between HTTP and SMTP</li>
        <li>HTTP uses a pull protocol</li>
        <li>A pull protocol is when information is loaded to a web server and the information can be pulled at convenience.</li>
        <li>SMTP uses a push protocol</li>
        <li>a push protocol pushes the information to the reciever. if the reciever doesn't get it/isn't able to, it will try again at a later time. </li>
        <li>SMTP requires the message to be in 7-bit ASCII while HTTP does not.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
