    <h1>Network Applications</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>It is important to write programs that run on different types of end systems.</li>
        <li>When writing the code, it should be written in a way that can be run on multiple end systems (written in java, C, or python)</li>
        <li>You don't need to write code that runs in network core devices like routers, or linked layer switches, because you can't</li>
        <li>Application Architecture</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-Server Architecture: there is an always-oh host called a server. that server services requests from many other hosts called clients</li>
            <li>two clients don't directly communicate with each other</li>
            <li>the server has an IP address</li>
            <li>Client can always contact the server by sending packets to the IP address</li>
            <li>Data Center: a large virtual server housing a large number of hosts. It is used if only one server is handling all the requests and it is being overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Peer-to-peer or P2P doesnt rely on dedicated servers</li>
            <li>p2p connects hosts directly called peers</li>
            <li>peers are personal devices</li>
            <li>self scalability: peers create the workload, but also take the workload.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
