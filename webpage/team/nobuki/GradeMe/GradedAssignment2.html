        <h1>Graded Exercise 2</h1>
        <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nobuki-harata-86910a79">link text</a>
        <p>Here are the main points I learned about LinkedIn and networking</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Most employers look at a possible employee LinkedIn page.</li>
            <li>Wording matters a lot in your resume and your profile. You should be trying your best to show employers what your skills are. You should give direct information while removing clutter.</li>
            <li>Networking can be fun. You just need to talk to people.</li>
            <li>If you help others connect, people will help you connect.</li>
            <li>On LinkedIn and your resume, you should try to show your most important attributes and experiences first.</li>
            <li>You can get a lot of jobs if you network well, even if there are more qualified people out there.</li>
        </ul>
