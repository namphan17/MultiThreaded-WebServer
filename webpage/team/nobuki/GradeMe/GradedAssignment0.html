        <h3>Questions on Reading</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the difference between a DDoS attack and a DoS attack, and why is it harder to protect against?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The source of the attack is distributed in a DDoS, so instead of blocking just one source, you must block multiple, which is much harder to do. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>What year (give or take 6 years) was the first packet switch installed?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1969</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the equation for the end-to-end Delay for one packet and what does each constant/variable stand for?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a.	dend-to-end=N(L/R)</li>
                    <li>b.	N is the number of links. L is the number of bits and R is the transmission rate (bits/second)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>3.	What are 4 of the 5 layers of a 5 layer internet protocol stack?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Application, Transport, Network, Link, Physical</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the main difference between a client-server architecture and a p2p architecture?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A client-server has a server that connects between the clients. In a p2p architecture, the clients connect to each other directly. Those clients are called peers.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What is the main purpose of cookies?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To allow sites to keep track of its users</li>
                </ul>
            <li>What protocols do HTTP and SMTP use? How are they different?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a.	HTTP uses a pull protocol and SMTP uses push protocol.</li>
                    <li>b.	A push protocol will push the information to the receiver, while a pull protocol will load the information on a web server and the client can pull the information at any time. </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Describe the rarest first technique.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>When torrenting, out of the chunks you don't have, you request to rarest (least amount of uploaders have the chunk) chunk first.</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>Bob Metcalfe</h3>
        <p>Bob Metcalfe, the inventor if the Ethernet and the man who started 3com, had an interesting career. It all started when he was a graduate student at Stanford. Metcalfe had a job lined up for after graduation. However, Harvard failed his PhD thesis defense, but Xerox still told him to come to the job and finish the PhD while he was working for them. While he was at Xerox, he read an article about a radio-based network in Hawaii called Alohanet. Metcalfe saw the flaws in the network and created his own version which he called the Ethernet. The Ethernet alone was a great idea, but Xerox didn’t market the Ethernet how Metcalfe wanted, so he created his own company to achieve that. He called it 3com. 
Unfortunately, the company board determined that there were better candidates for a CEO than him, so he was moved to be the vice president of sales. During his time creating and working at 3com, he spent 10 years selling the Ethernet. After that, he decided to stop working there and become a magazine journalist for InfoWorld, because he preferred to influence the whole world instead of one company. 
The interesting part of Bob Metcalfe is that he doesn’t attribute his success to the invention of the Ethernet. He thinks that people have great ideas all the time, but that’s not what gave him success. What gave his real success is a combination of two things: his charismatic talent of being able to communicate well, and the fact that he spent 10 years selling his product while trying to make it the standard. Metcalfe got his PhD after he invented the Ethernet and wrote his PhD thesis on that.

        <h3>GitHub Tutorial</h3>
        <p>GitHub is a website where you can work on a project with others. How it works is that someone starts a project on their account. He can modify it at any time. Then someone else can also start working on the project by making a clone of the project. Once the clone is made, he will have his own copy that will update separately from the original creator’s files. When the new programmer makes a change, he will commit the changes and then will need to create a pull request on the changes. That pull request will insert the changes made into the original account’s files. Since many others could make changes, the new programmer could do a fetch remote to update his files to match what is on the original creator’s files. 
To do this on GitHub, you must find the files that the original creator made. Once you find that, you must fork the files. On the top right side of the page, there is a button that says fork. You will click on that, which will make your copy of the files. This is where you will make your changes. You can navigate through the files and open a file you want to work on. Then you should click on the “Edit this file” button (which looks like a pencil). Once the desired changes are made, you will scroll down and commit the changes. Then you will return to the page that was created when you made the fork. There you will find a “New pull request” button. You will click on that and submit the pull request.
