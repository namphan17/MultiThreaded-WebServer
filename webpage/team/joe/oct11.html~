      <tr>
	<th>Basic</th>
	<th>Retransmits all the frames that sent after the frame which suspects to be damaged or lost.</th>
	<th>Retransmits only those frames that are suspected to lost or damaged.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Bandwidth Utilization</th>
	<th>If error rate is high, it waste a lot of bandwidth</th>
	<th>Comparatively less bandwidth is wasted in retransmitting.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Complexity</th>
	<th>Less complicated</th>
	<th>More complex as it requires to apply extra logic and sorting and storage, at sender and receiver.</th>

	<th>Window size</th>
	<th>N-1</th>
	<th><= (N+1)/2 </th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Sorting</th>
	<th>Sorting is neither required at sender side nor at receiver side.</th>
	<th>Receiver must be able to sort as it has to maintain the sequence of the frames.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Storing</th>
	<th>Receivers do not store the frames received after the damaged frame until the damaged frame is retransmitted.</th>
	<th>Receivers store the frames received after the damaged frame in the buffer until the damaged frame is replaced.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>Searching</th>
	<th>No searching of frame is required neither on the sender side nor on the receiver side.</th>
	<th>The sender must be able to search and select only the requested frame.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<th>ACK Numbers</th>
	<th>NAK number refer to the next expected frame number.</th>
	<th>NAK number refer to the frame lost.</th>
