    <h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h1>
    <p> Djikstra's algorithm (named after its discover, E.W. Dijkstra) solves the problem of finding the shortest path from a point in a graph (the source) to a destination. It turns out that one can find the shortest paths from a given source to all points in a graph in the same time, hence this problem is sometimes called the single-source shortest paths problem.</p>
    <h3>Least Effort / Lowest Cost</h3>
    <br>
    <p> Steps to create Dijkstra's Algorithm</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Initialization of all nodes with distance "infinite". Initalization of the starting node with 0.</li>
      <li>Marking of the distance of the starting node as permanent.</li>
      <li>Setting of starting node as active.</li>
      <li>Calculation of the distanced of all neighboring nodes by summing up its distance with the weights of the edges</li>
      <li>If a calculated distance of a node is smaller than the current one, update the distance and set the current node as antecessor. **<b>Dijkstra's Central Idea</b>**</li>
      <li>Setting of the node with the minimal distance as active. Mark its distance as permanent</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 4 - 7 until there aren't any nodes left with a permanenet distance, with neighbors that have temporary distances</li>
    </ol>
