    <h4>Throughput</h4>
    <p>The rate at which the sending process can deliver bits to the receiving orocess.</p>
    <h4>Bandwidth-sensitive applications</h4>
    <p>Applications that have throughput requirements.</p>
    <h4>Elastic applications</h4>
    <p>Applications can use as little, or as much throughput as it happens to be available.</p>
    <h4>Timing</h4>
    <p>A transport-layer protocol can also provide timing guarantees.</p>
    <h4>Security</h4>
    <p>Encryption, data integrity, end-point authentication</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Transport Services Provided by the Internet</h2>
    <h4>TCP Services</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Connection-oriented Service</b> -- Client and server exchange transport-layer control information with each other <i>BEFORE</i> the application-level message begin to flow</li>
      <li><b>Reliable Data Transfer Service</b> -- Communicating process can rely on TCP to deliver all data sent without error and in the proper order</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>UDP Services</h4>
    <p>UDP is lightweight and provides minimal services.  UDP prodvides <i>no</i> guarantee that the message will ever reach the receiving process. Also, messages tend to arrive out of order.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Network Applications We Will Cover</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Web</li>
      <li>File Transfer</li>
      <li>Electronic Mail</li>
      <li>Directory Services</li>
      <li>P2P Applications</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web and HTTP</h2>
    <h4>World Wide Web</h4>
    <h4>HyperText Transfer Protocol - HTTP</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A client program and a Server program</li>
      <li>HTTP define the structure of the messages and how the client and server exchange the messages</li>
      <li>HTTP is a stateless protocol - The server maintains no information about the clients</li>
      <li>Round-Trip Time -- which is the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client</li>
      <li>Content Distribution Networks -- CDNs</li>
    </ul>
