		<h1 class="section">CHAPTER 2.6.1: Peer-to-Peer File Distribution</h1>
		</div>
		<h3 class="section">1. Scalability of P2P architectures</h3>
		<p>Assume we have the server and the peers connected to the Internet with access links. Let say :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The server’s access link is u<sub>s</sub></li>
			<li>The upload rate of the ith peer’s access link by u<sub>i</sub>,</li>
			<li>The size of the file to be distributed (in bits) is F.</li>
			<li>The number of peers that want to obtain a copy of the file by N.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The <b>distribution time</b> is the time it takes to get a copy of the file to all N peers.</p>
		<p>We denote distribution time for the client-server architecture by D<sub>cs</sub>.</p>
		<p>D<sub>cs</sub> is greater than or equal to the maximum value between NF/u<sub>s</sub> and F/d<sub>min</min></p>
		<p>In P2P architecture, each peer can assist the server in distributing the file. In particular, when a peer receives some file data, it can use its own upload capacity to redistribute the data to other peers.</p>
		<p>D<sub>P2P</sub> is greater than or equal to the maximum value among F/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>, and NF/(u<sub>s</sub>+u<sub>1</sub>+u<sub>2</sub>+...+u<sub>N</sub>)</p>
		<p>The client-server architecture, the distribution time increases linearly and without bound as the number of peers increases. However, for the P2P architecture, the minimal distribution time is not only always less than the distribution time of the client-server architecture; it is also less than one hour for any number of peers N.</p>
		<h3 class="section">2. BitTorrent</h3>
		<p>A <b>torrent</b> is the collection of all peers participating in the distribution of a particular file.</p>
		<p>Peers in a torrent download equal-size <p>chunks</p> of the file from one another, with a typical chunk size of 256 KBytes. While it downloads chunks it also uploads chunks to other peers.</p>
		<p>Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a <b>tracker</b>. When a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs the tracker that it is still in the torrent. In this manner, the tracker keeps track of the peers that are participating in the torrent.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>When a new peer joins the torrent, the tracker randomly selects a subset of peers from the set of participating peers, and sends the IP addresses of these peers to this new peer.</li>
			<li>Possessing this list of peers, the new peer attempts to establish concurrent TCP connections with all the peers on this list.</li>
			<li>Let’s call all the peers with which the new peer succeeds in establishing a TCP connection “neighboring peers.”</li>
			<li>At any given time, each peer will have a subset of chunks from the file, with different peers having different subsets.</li>
			<li>Periodically, the user will ask each of her neighboring peers (over the TCP connections) for the list of the chunks they have. If the user has L different neighbors, she will obtain L lists of chunks.</li>
			<li><b>Rarest first</b>: The idea is to determine, from among the chunks she does not have, the chunks that are the rarest among her neighbors (that is, the chunks that have the fewest repeated copies among her neighbors) and then request those rarest chunks first.</li>
			<li>To determine which requests sthe user responds to, BitTorrent uses a clever trading algorithm. The basic idea is that she gives priority to the neighbors that are currently supplying her data at the highest rate.</li>
			<li>Every 30 seconds, Alice will randomly choose a new trading partner and initiate trading with that partner. If the two peers are satisfied with the trading, they will put each other in their top four lists and continue trading with each other until one of the peers finds a better partner.</li>
			<li>The effect is that peers capable of uploading at compatible rates tend to find each other.</li>
			<li><b>Unchoked</b>: feeding chunks to Alice; <b>Choked</b>: receiving no chunks from Alice.</li>
		</ul>
