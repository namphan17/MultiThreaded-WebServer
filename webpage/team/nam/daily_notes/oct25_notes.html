               <li>Wireless hosts. As in the case of wired networks, hosts are the end-system devices that run applications. A wireless host might be a laptop, palmtop, smartphone, or desktop computer. The hosts themselves may or may not be mobile.</li>
               <li>Wireless links. A host connects to a base station (defined below) or to another wireless host through a wireless communication link. Different wireless link technologies have different transmission rates and can transmit over different distances.</li>
               <li>Base station. The base station is a key part of the wireless network infrastructure. Unlike the wireless host and wireless link, a base station has no obvious counterpart in a wired network. Abase station is responsible for sending and receiving data (e.g., packets) to and from a wireless host that is associated with that base station.</li>
               <li>Cell towers in cellular networks and access points in 802.11 wireless LANs are examples of base stations.</li>
               <li>Hosts associated with a base station are often referred to as operating in infrastructure mode, since all traditional network services (e.g., address assignment and routing) are provided by the network to which a host is connected via the base station.</li>
               <li>In ad hoc networks, wireless hosts have no such infrastructure with which to connect. In the absence of such infrastructure, the hosts themselves must provide for services such as routing, address assignment, DNS-like name translation, and more.</li>
               <li>At the highest level we can classify wireless networks according to two criteria: (i) whether a packet in the wireless network crosses exactly one wireless hop or multiple wireless hops, and (ii) whether there is infrastructure such as a base station in the network:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Single-hop, infrastructure-based</li>
                     <li>Single-hop, infrastructure-less</li>
                     <li>Multi-hop, infrastructure-based</li>
                     <li>Multi-hop, infrastructure-less. There is no base station in these networks, and nodes may have to relay messages among several other nodes in order to reach a destination. Nodes may also be mobile, with connectivity changing among nodesâ€”a class of networks known as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
