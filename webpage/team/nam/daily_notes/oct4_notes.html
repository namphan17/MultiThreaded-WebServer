            <p>Malware can: deleting our files, installing spyware the steal private information.</p>
            <p>A botnet: is a network of infected devices, controlled by bad guys.</p>
            <p>Self-replication: once malware infects one host, from that host, it seeks entry into other hosts over the Internet</p>

            <h5>Denial-of-service (DOS) attack</h5>
            <ul>
               <li>Vulnerability Attack</li>
               <p>This involves sending a few well-crafted messages to a vulnerable
                  application or operating system running on a targeted host. If the right
                  sequence of packets is sent to a vulnerable application or operating system, the
                  service can stop or, worse, the host can crash.
               </p>
               <li>Bandwidth flooding</li>
               <p>The attacker sends a deluge of packets to the targeted
                  host—so many packets that the target’s access link becomes clogged, preventing
                  legitimate packets from reaching the server.
               </p>
               <p>Distributed DOS (DDOS) attack: the attacker controls multiple sources
                  and has each source send traffic at the target. With this approach, the aggregate traffic
                  rate across all the controlled sources needs to be approximately R to cripple the service.
               </p>
               <li>Connection Flooding</li>
               <p>The attacker establishes a large number of half-open or
                  fully open TCP connections at the target host. The host can become so bogged down with 
                  these bogus connections that it stops accepting legitimate connections.

               <h3 class="section">Sniffing packets</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>Packet sniffer: a passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that flies by, 
                     when it's placed in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Sniffer can be deployed also in wired environment.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>Sniffed packets can then be analyzed offline for sensitive information.</p>

               <h3>Pretending as someone you trust</h3>
            </li>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>IP spoofing: The ability to injectpackets into the Internet with a false source address,
                     and is but one of many ways in which one user can masquerade as another user.
