            There are two models of networking, one with 5 layers and one with 7 layers. How does the model with 5 layers handle the loss of two levels of

                    The Internet protocol stack (5 layer model) handles the loss of two layers from the ISO OSI model (7 layer model) by placing the two lost
                    layers into the highest layer and leaves the tasks assigned to those layers to the Application programmers.
