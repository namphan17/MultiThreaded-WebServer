        &emsp; &emsp;Dr. Leo L. Beranek is an alum of Cornell College (Class of 1936) and Harvard University (Class of 1940). He is best known for his work in Acoustical Engineering and has received multiple awards for his work including the National Medal of Science, and an IEEE Founders medal. 
<br>
&emsp;Leo was born in 1914 in Solon Iowa. Leo&#39;s interest in radio and sound began when his father brought home a vacuum tube radio. Leo&#39;s family moved to Mt. Vernon after his mother died and his father remarried. In Mt. Vernon, Leo took his father&#39;s advice and learned radio repair at the local hardware store. Leo applied and was accepted to Cornell College in 1929. His, as well as the nations,  finical situation however was rough due to the Wall Street Market crash in 1929, as such Leo was told by his father that he was own his own as a far as paying for school was concerned. 
<br> <br>
&emsp;While his time at Cornell Leo continued his interest in radio and technology, studying Morse Code and even earning an amateur radio license. Because of his financial situation Leo was forced to drop of of Cornell in 1934 in order to earn more money for his tuition. When he returned to Cornell in 1935 Leo had a change encounter with Harvard professor Glenn Browning, who was driving through Mt. Vernon when he got a flat tire. Glenn encouraged Leo to apply to Harvard for Graduate school. Where he received a doctorate in 1940.
<br>
&emsp;During World War II Leo was in charge of Harvard's electro-acoustics laboratory, designing  communications systems for aircraft. During WWII Leo also worked on building the first anechoic chamber. The chamber could be used to study sound and sound technology. After the war Leo taught as a professor of communications engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1947 to 1958. While at MIT Leo helped found Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) which created Telnet, the first public packet-switching network. 
<br>
&emsp;After working with BBN Leo wrote several books about acoustics including several classic books. These books, as well have Leo&#39;s insight have been used as as inspiration for several opera houses across the globe.
