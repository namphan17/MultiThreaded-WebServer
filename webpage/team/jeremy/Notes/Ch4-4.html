		Link State vs. Distance Vector
	</h4>
	<p>
		<b>Link State Protocol</b><br>
		Link state protocol creates a map of the network and then determines the fastest path through the network using 
		<i>Dijkstra's algorithm</i>, but before the algorithm can be run a map of the network needs to be built. To do
		this the following steps are taken:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The neighbours of each node, in case the routers, are found</li>
		<li>Each router periodically checks its connection with each of its neighbours, and uses this to figure out each connections &ldquo;weight&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Using the weights, a map of the fastest path  from any two routers can be created</li>
		<br>
	</ol>

		<br>
		<b>Distance Vector Protocol</b><br>
		Each node (router) knows only two things about the network around it:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The direction the packet is going</li>
		<li>The distance of that packet from its destination</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Using this information each router passes the packet roughly in the direction that it needs to go, using the shortest path.
