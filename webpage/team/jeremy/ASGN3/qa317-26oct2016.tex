  \item A shared communications channel has a bandwidth of 3 Mbps.
    Each subscriber requires a bandwidth of 150 kbps when
    using the channel.
    Each subscriber uses the channel only 10\% of the time.

    This means that the capacity of the channel is sufficient to
    allow simultaneous communications by $20$ subscribers.

    This means that the probability $p$ that any given subscriber is active at any given moment
    is $0.1$.

    The probability that exactly $n$ of $N$ subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    when the probability that any individual subscriber is communicating is $p$ is:

    \begin{align*}
      P_{p} (n \mid N ) & = \frac{N!}{n! (N - n)!} (p)^n (1.0 - p)^{N - n}
      \end{align*}

    The probability that exactly n of 120 subscribers are simultaneously communicating
    is\ldots

    \begin{align*}
      P_{0.1} (n \mid 120 ) & = \frac{120!}{n! (120 - n)!} (0.1)^n (1.0 - 0.1)^{120 - n}
      \end{align*}

    With the help of a \href{http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/binomial.aspx}{calculator}
    we can find the probability that $21$ or more
    subscribers are active at once.
  
    The online calculator displays input fields for ``Probability of success on a single trial,''
    ``Number of trials,'' and ``Number of successes (x).''
    Enter values of $0.1$, $120$, and $21$ in these fields
    Click on the calculate button.
    Look for the probability that $21$ or more subscribers are simultaneously active
    in the output field that is labeled ``Cumulative probability: $P(X \ge 21)$.''

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What is the probability that at any given moment
        $21$ or more subscribers will be communicating?
      \item What happens in a packet switched network when subscribers
        request more bandwidth than the channel can provide.
      \item What can you infer from this result about an advantage
        of packet switched communications?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The probability that at any given moment 21 or more subscribers will be communicating is 0.00794 or 0.794\%.
    \item Transmission causes packet delays and packet lost. 
    \item Packet switching networks can handle more host and allocate bandwidth.
    \end{enumerate}

  \item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item How many bits are in an IPv4 address?

    \item If all bits in an IPv4 address were available for specifying
      addresses of different machines on the Internet, how many hosts
      could the Internet connect?

    \item The dotted decimal notation is a way of writing IPv4 addresses.
      
      Find the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ by typing:

      \verb+nslookup www.eonsahead.com+

      Express the IPv4 address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ in
      dotted decimal notation.?

    \item The dotted decimal notation presents an address as
      four decimal numbers, each in the range of $0$ to $255$,
      and separated from one another by periods.

      A number $x$ in the range of $0$ to $255$ can be expressed
      in hexadecimal notation with two hexadecimal digits.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item The first (most significant) digit is $x / 16$.
        The division is integer division.

      \item The second (least significant) digit is $x \bmod 16$.

      \item Here is an example: $77_{10} \equiv 4D$ because\ldots
      \begin{itemize}
        \item  $77 / 16 = 4$
        \item $77 \bmod 16 = 13$
        \item the hexadecimal digit that represents $13$ is $D$

    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item There are 32 bits in a IPv4 address.
    \item If all the bits in an IPv4 address were used we could have $2^{32}$ addresses. 
    \item The dotted decimal address of \verb+www.eonsahead.com+ is 45.40.136.115.

  \item An IPv6 address contains 128 bits. With 128 bits, it
    is possible to represent $2^{128}$ addresses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Look up the current population of the earth. What integer
      power of two most closely approximates this number?
    \item What is the integer power of ten that most closely
      approximates $2^{128}$?

      Here are some relationships that you might find helpful.

      \begin{align*}
        2^{10} & \approx 1000 = 10^3 \\
        2^{20} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^6 \\
        2^{30} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^9 \\
        2^{40} & = 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot 2^{10} \approx
            10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 10^3 = 10^{12}
        \end{align*}

      In general, if $2^x = 10^y$, then $y$ is approximately equal to $x/y$: $2^{40} \approx 10^{40/3}$.
      
    \item How many IPv6 addresses would each person on earth have if the addresses
      were evenly distributed?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The current population of Earth is about 7.125 billion people.
    \item $2^{128}$ is best represented in integer power of ten with $10^{38}$
    \item Each person on earth could have about $4.7*10^{28}$ IPv6 addresses.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

    \end{answer}

  \item Port numbers are $16$ bit addresses. A $16$ bit address is large
    enough to specify any one of $65536$ different ports. What is a programmer
    addressing when a programmer specifies a port number?

  \begin{answer}
    Port number is a way to specify the process that a packet should be sent to within a machine. 
    \end{answer}

      and port numbers.)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Transport layer segments
    \item Network layer datagrams
    \item Link layer Ethernet frames
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item DHCP is a client-server protocol.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What does this service provide to clients? (It may provide more than one item.) 
    \item Under what circumstances is a DHCP service especially useful?
    \item Which transport level protocol and which port number is used by
      a host to discover a DHCP server?
    \item DHCP uses an IP address that is reserved for broadcast. 
      A host that joins a network is a client.
      The exchange between a DHCP client and a DHCP server begins when
      the client broadcasts a \emph{discover message}.
      The client broadcasts this message because it does not yet know
      any addresses (including most particularly the address of the DHCP
      server) in the network.
      The server responds by broadcasting an \emph{offer message}.

      Why does the server also broadcast the \emph{offer message}?

    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The main service that DHCP provides clients with a valid IP address, subnet mask and default gateway. 
    \item DHCP is especially useful in networks where hosts come and go.
    \item DHCP clients use UDP port number 67 to find servers, and port 68 to find clients. 
    \item The \emph{offer message} is sent to the client so that the client knows which IP address it has been given. 
	The client knows that the IP address is intended for them because the \emph{offer message} includes the client's MAC address. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item What are several possible objections to the use of NAT?

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item NATs use ports in ways other than their intended use of addressing process.
    \item Routers are only supposed to process packets up to layer 3 
    \item NATs violate end-to-end arguments.
    \item NATs and IPv6 are different ways to solve the IP address shortage and many people suggest using IPv6 rather than NATs.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item DNS and ARP both translate between two kinds of addresses.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Between which two kinds of addresses does DNS translate?

    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) defines a limit at which
      layer of the Internet protocol stack?
    \item The MSS (Maximum Segment Size) defines a limit at which
      layer of the Internet protocol stack?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item MTU is the limit on a packet in the network layer. 
    \item MSS is the limit on a packet in the transport layer.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item The link-state algorithm associates a number and a label with
    each node in a network. The algorithm assigns an initial value
    of $\infty$ to the number and $NULL$ (unknown) to the label.
    It updates these values in the course of its execution.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item What does the number denote?
    \item What does the label denote?
    \end{enumerate}
  
  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The number represents the distance between the that node and the
node at the start of the spanning tree.
    \item The label denotes the node one "step" closer to node at the start of
the spanning tree. These labels can be used to traces the tree back to
it’s start from the end, by following each node down the tree.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item The Bellman-Ford equation describes a relationship that
    is the basis of the distance-vector routing algorithm.

    Combine the following mathematical expressions

    $d_v(y)$ & distance from $v$ to $y$ along shortest path between the two nodes \\
    $\{ \cdots \}$ & a set \\
    ${\min}_v$ & \parbox[t]{10cm}{minimum value in collection of values that
      depend upon $v$, for all values of $v$}

  \item In the following table, the first four elements of the
    first four rows are data. The fifth element in each of the 
    first four rows is a parity bit computed for that row.
    The elements of the fifth row are parity bits computed
    for the columns.

    The parity bits have been chosen to make the number of
    ones in a row (or column) even.
    For example, only one of the data bits in the first row
    is a one. Making the parity bit a one makes the total
    number of ones in the row even.

  \begin{tabular}{llll|l}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
    \end{tabular}

    Now suppose that noise in the communication line
    alters a bit during the transmission of this table.
    The receiver sees this table:

  \begin{tabular}{llll|l}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What can the receiver know?
      \item What can the receiver do?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The receiver knows that a error has occurred in the message.
    \item The receiver can fix the error by looking at the bit that is in both the row and column that have the wrong parity bit, and change that bit to correct the error.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item This problem is about a CSMA/CD network.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $d_{prog}$ be the upper bound on the time required
      for front edge of a signal to travel (propagate) between two network adapters (interfaces).
    \item Let $d_{tran}$ be the time required to transmit the largest frame.
    \item Let $E$ be the efficiency of the network. ``Efficiency'' means the
      fraction of time (computed over a long run) in which frames are passing
      between adapters without collision. Assume that there are many adapters
      with many frames to send.
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{align*}
    E & \approx \frac{1}{1 + 5 \cdot \frac{d_{prog}}{d_{tran}}}
    \end{align*}

    Here is an analogy: Imagine a large school. There are many rooms.
    A single hallway connects the rooms. At unpredictable times, groups of students in
    one room pass through the hall to another room. A group of art
    students might move from the studio to the library. Another group of
    students might later move from the chemistry laboratory to the gymnasium.
    After that, a third group of students might walk from their English class to
    the nurse's office.

    A rule forbids more than one group of students to be in the hall at once.
    If the chemistry students open the door and see the art students in the hall,
    they must duck back into their laboratory, check the hallway for traffic
    again at a later time, and proceed only when the see at that the hallway
    is empty.

    In this case, $d_{prog}$ is a measure of how fast the students walk,
    and $d_{tran}$ is a measure of how much time it takes to get a group
    of students through a classroom door into the hall.
    The amount of time that a group spends in the hall is a function
    both of how fast the students walk and how many students are in the
    group.

    Efficiency is the fraction of time during which there are students
    in the hallway moving between rooms.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{prog}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \item Does $E$ increase when $d_{tran}$ is increased or when it is decreased?
      \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $E$ increases when $d_{prog}$ is decreased.  
    \item $E$ increases when $d_{tran}$ is increased.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{answer}

  \item Both routers and switches store and forward packets.
    Routers execute layer 3 protocols. In layer 3, IP addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Switches execute layer 2 protocols. In layer 2, MAC addresses determine
    where packets go.
    Even so, network administrators can often choose to connect two networks
    using a router instead of a switch (or vice versa). 
    Network administrators need to know the advantages and disadvantages of
    each kind of device.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Hierarchical addressing and an easier avoidance of cycles (an attractive characteristic)
      is a property of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item ''Plug-and-play'' (an attractive characteristic) is a property of which
      kind of device: router or switch?
    \item Faster processing of packets (an attractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \item The option of choosing from a greater variety of topologies (an attractive characteristic)
      follows from the selection of which kind of device: routers or switches?
      A greater variety of topologies means freedom from the constraint of avoiding multiple links
      between elements in a network. The network need not be a spanning tree, but can be a more
      general kind of graph.
    \item Susceptibility to broadcast storms (an unattractive characteristic) is a property
      of which kind of device: router or switch?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Hierarchical addressing is used in routers.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The computation is a long division. As in any long division, the computation
      requires subtractions of multiples of the divisor. How does the method of subtraction
      differs from ordinary subtraction? 
    \item What is the bit string that the sender will transmit?
    \item What kinds of errors can the receiver detect?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item This method of long division replaces subtraction with exclusive OR, XOR.
    \item The sender will send both the Data D, and the CRC remainder (R), so that this division operation can be done. 
    \item CRC can detect burst errors that are less than the generator's length long.
    \end{enumerate}
