	<h3>Reliable Data Transfer</h3>

	<p>A reliable data transfer is used with a reliable channel, where no transferred data bits are
	corrupted and all are delivered in the order in which they were sent.</p>
	
	<p>TCP is a reliable data transfer protocol, however it is implemented on top of an unreliable
	end-to-end network layer (IP).</p>

	<h3>Building a Reliable Data Transfer Protocol</h3>
	
	<h4>Reliable Data Transfer over a Perfectly Reliable Channel</h4>

	<p><b>Finite-State Machine</b>: an abstract machine that can be in one of a finite number of states.</p>
	
	<p> There are <b>seperate</b> FSM's for the sender and the receiver, and they each have one state.</p>
	
	<p>The sending side of the data transfer accepts data from the upper layer via the
	<b>rdt_send(data)</b> event, creates a packet containing the data via the <b>make_pkt(data)</b>
	event, and sends the packet into the channel.</p>
	
	<p>On the receiving side, the data transfer receives a packet from the underlying channel via the
	<b>rdt_rcv(packet)</b> event, and removes the data from the packet via the action <b>extract (packet, data)</b>.

	<h4>Reliable Data Transfer over a Channel with Bit Errors</h4>

	<p>The message dictation protocol uses <b>positive and negative acknowledgements</b>, which let the
	sender know what has been received successfully, and what has been received in an error. Reliable data transfer
	protocols based on this retransmission are known as <b>Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols.</b></p>
	
	<p>Three additional protocol capabilities are required in ARQ protocols to handle the presence of bit errors:<p>
	
	<ul><li><b>Error detection: </b>Requires extra bits be sent along with the data for detection and correction
		(i.e. UDP uses Internet checksum field)</li>
		<li><b>Receiver feedback: </b>Because the sender and receiver are typically very distant from each other,
		it requires explicit feedback from the receiver. (i.e. positive (ACK) and negative (NAK) acknowledgement replies)</li>
		<li><b>Retransmission: </b>A packet that is received in error at the receiver will be retransmitted by the
		sender.</li>
	</ul>
