	<h3>What is DNS?</h3>
	
	<h4>The Domain Name System</h4>
	<p>The domain name system, or DNS, is a heirarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any
	   resource connected to the internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names
	   assigned to each of the participating entities. Hosts are identified by a host-name and an IP address. This is 
	   because it is easy to identify by humans from the host-name and easy to identify by the network from the IP 
	   address, and so must be translated accordingly.</p>
	<h4>The DNS is</h4>
	<ul><li>a distributed database implemented in a heirarchy of DNS servers</li>
	    <li>an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database</li>
	</ul>
	<p>DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols including:</p>
	<ul><li>HTML</li>
	    <li>SMTP</li>
		<li>FTP</li>
	</ul>
