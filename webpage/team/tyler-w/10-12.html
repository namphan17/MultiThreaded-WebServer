	<h3>TCP Congestion Control</h3>
	<p>TCP must use end-to-end congestion control rather than network-assisted congestion control, because the
	IP layer provides no explicit feedback to the end systems regarding network connection.</p>
	
	<h4>The TCP Approach</h4>
	<p>It has each sender limit the rate at which it sends traffic into its connections as a function of
	perceived network congestion. If a TCP sender perceives that there is little congestion on the path between
	itself and the destination, then the TCP sender increases its send rate. This brings about a few questions:</p>
	<ul><li>How does a TCP sender limit the rate at which it sends traffic into its connection?</li><br>
	    <li>How does a TCP sender perceive that there is congestion on the path between itself and the destination?</li><br>
		<li>What algorithm should the sender use to change its send rate as a function of perceived end-to-end congestion?</li><br>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>How a TCP sender limits the traffic rate</h4>
	<p>The TCP congestion-control mechanism operating at the sender keeps track of an additional variable, the
	<b>congestion window</b>, which imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the 
	network.</p>
	
	<p>The amount of unacknowledged data at a sender may not exceed the minimum of <b id="cour">cwnd</b> and 
	<b id="cour">rwnd</b>.
	
	<p><b id="cour">LastByteSent - LastByteAcked &le; min{cwnd, rwnd}</b> <br><br> (By adjusting the values, the sender can
	adjust the rate at which it sends data into its connection.)</p>
	
	<h4>How a TCP sender perceives that there is congestion</h4>

	<p>When there is excessive congestion, then one or more routers buffers along the path
	overflows, causing a datagram containing a TCP segment to be dropped. This results in a 
	loss event at the sender, either a timeout or the receipt of three duplicate ACKS, which
	is taken by the sender to be an indication of congestion on the sender-to-receiver path.</p>

	<p>When a loss event does not occur, TCP takes the arrival of the acknowledgements as an indication that the
	packets were successfully delivered and will use acknowledgements to increase its congestion window size. If
	acknowledgements arrive at a slow rate, the congestion window will be increased at a slower rate. If acknowledgements
	arrive at a fast rate, the congestion window will be increased at a faster rate.</p>
	
	<p>TCP is said to be <b>self-clocking</b> because it uses acknowledgements to trigger, or clock, its increase in
	congestion window size.</p>
	
	<h4>How should a TCP sender determine the rate at which it should send?</h4>
	<p>If TCP senders collectively send too fast, they can congest the network. If they send too slowly, then they
	are under-utilizing the bandwidth in the network.</p>
	
	<ul><li><b>Lost Segments</b>: lost segments imply congestion, so the TCP sender's rate should be decreased when
	a segment is lost.</li><br>
		<li><b>Acknowledged Segments</b>: An acknowledged segment indicates that the network is delivering the
	sender's segments to the receiver, so the sender's rate can be increased when an ACK arrives for a previously
	unacknowledged segment.</li><br>
		<li><b>Bandwidth Probing</b>: The TCP sender uses both successful and unsuccessful deliveries as a strategy to probe 
		for the threshold between the two. The TCP sender will probe until a loss event occurs, at which point it will decrease
		the transmission rate. It then begins to probe again, to see if that threshold has changed.</li><br>
	</ul> <p> There is no explicit signaling of congestion state by the network; ACKs and loss events serve as implicit signals.
	Each TCP sender acts on local information asynchronously from other TCP senders.</p>
	
	<h4>What algorithm should the sender use to change the transmission rate?</h4>
	<h5>TCP Congestion-Control Algorithm</h5>
	<p>The algorithm has three major components:</p>
	<ul><li><b>Slow Start</b>: the value of <b id="cour">cwnd</b> is initialized to a small value, and is exponentially increased every
	time a transmitted segment is acknowledged.</li><br>
		<li><b>Congestion Avoidance</b>: Upon entry to this state, the value of <b id="cour">cwnd</b> is about half its 
	value when congestion was last encountered. Rather than exponentially increasing, it simply increases the value of
	<b id="cour">cwnd</b> by 1.</li><br>
		<li><b>Fast Recovery</b>: The value of <b id="cour">cwnd</b> is increased by 1 for every duplicate ACK received
	for the missing segment that caused TCP to enter this state in the first place. When an ACK arrives, TCP enters the
	congestion-avoidance state after deflating <b id="cour">cwnd</b>. If a timeout event occurs, fast recovery transitions
	to the slow-start state after setting <b id="cour">cwnd</b> to 1 and the threshold is set to half of the value <b id="cour">cwnd</b>
	was before. This state is recommended, but not required.</li><br><br>
	</ul>
