		<h3>Network Address Translation (NAT)</h3>
		
		<p>A <b>Network Address Translation</b>, or NAT, is a method of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying
		network address information in IP datagram packet headers while they are in transit.</p>
		
		<p>There are many home networks that use the same address space; however packets forwarded beyond the home
		network into larger global internet cannot use these addresses in any way, because there are hundreds
		of thousands of networks using this block of addresses. The home network addresses can only have meaning within
		the home network.</p>
		
		<p>The NAT-enabled router does not look like a router to the outside world. It behaves as a single device with
		a single IP address. All of the traffic entering and exiting the home network must have the same source
		address and destination address.</p>
		
		<p>The home network computers get their addresses and the router gets its single IP address from DHCP. DHCP, or
		<b>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</b>, is a standardized network protocol used on IP networks. It is controlled 
		by a DHCP server that dynamically distributes network configuration parameters, such as IP addresses. The router gets
		the IP address from the ISP's DHCP server, and the router runs a DHCP server to provide addresses to computers
		within the NAT-DHCP-router-controlled home network's address space.</p>
		
		<p>Because all of the incoming datagrams have the same destination IP address, there has to be a way for the router
		to distinguish between internal hosts. The router does this by using a <b>NAT Translation Table</b> at the NAT router,
		which includes port numbers and IP addresses in the table.</p>
		
		<h4>How NAT Works</h4>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Local host (10.0.0.1) requests a web page on a web server (port 80) with IP address 128.119.40.186</li><br>
		<li>The local host assigns the (arbitrary) source port number 3345, sends datagram into the LAN</li><br>
		<li>The NAT router receives the datagram, generates a new source port number 5001</li><br>
		<ul><li>When generating a new source port number, the NAT router can select any source port number that is not currently 
		        in the NAT Translation Table)</li></ul><br>
		<li>The NAT router replaces the IP address and the source port number with its WAN-side IP address 138.76.29.7,
		and source port number 5001, and adds the entry into the NAT Translation Table<li><br>
		<li>The Web server responds with a datagram whose destination address is the IP address of the NAT router at port 5001</li><br>
		<li>When the datagram arrives at the NAT router, the router indexes the NAT Translation Table using the destination
		IP address and destination port number to obtain the appropriate address and port number for the local host.</li><br>
		<li>The router rewrites the datagram's destination address and port number, and forwards the datagram into the
		home network.</li><br>
		</ul>
