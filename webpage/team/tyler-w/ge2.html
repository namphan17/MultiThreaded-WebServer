		<h3>The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm</h3>
		
		<p>The link-state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra's algorithm. It computes the least-cost path from one
		node, the source, to all other nodes in the network. It does this by having each node broadcast link-state packets
		to all other nodes in the network, where each link-state packet contians the identities and costs of its attached
		links. The algorithm is iterative and has the property that after the <i>k</i>th iteration of the algorithm, the 
		least-cost paths are known to <i>k</i> destination nodes. Of all the least-cost paths to all destination nodes, \
		these <i>k</i> paths will have the <i>k</i> smallest costs.</p>
		
		<ul><li><i>D(v)</i>: cost of the least-cost path from the source node to destination <i>v</i> as of this iteration
		of the algorithm</li><br>
		<li><i>p(v)</i>: previous node (neighbor of <i>v</i>) along the current least-cost path from the source to <i>v</i></li><br>
		<li><i>N'</i>: subset of nodes; <i>v</i> is in <i>N'</i> if the least-cost path from the source to <i>v</i> is
		definitively known</li><br>
		</ul>

		<h3>Iterations of the Link-State Algorithm</h3>
		
		<p>We are going to compute the least-cost paths from <i>u</i> to all possible destinations using the network
		pictured below.</p>
		
		<h4>Step 0 (Initialization)</h4>
		
		<img src="LS001.jpeg" alt="LS001.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		
		<p>Starting with <i>u</i>, we see that the nodes connected to <i>u</i> are:
		<ul><li><i>v</i>, with a cost value of 2</li>
			<li><i>x</i>, with a cost value of 1</li>
			<li><i>w</i>, with a cost value of 5</li>
		</ul>
		
		<img src="LS002.jpeg" alt="LS002.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		<br><br>
		
		If you look in the data table below, you will see in the initialization (step 0) that for each
		<i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, and <i>w</i>, their cost values in relation to <i>u</i> are shown in their
		own column, along with the previous node of each, which is <i>u</i>. Because <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>
		are not directly connected to <i>u</i>, their values are set to infinity.
		
		</p>
		
		<img src="DT001.jpeg" alt="DT001.jpeg" style="width:480px;height:160px;" border="3">
		<br>
		
		<h4>Step 1</h4>
		<p>We have now completed our first step, the initialization. Now let us move to the first iteration.
		We must look for the nodes that have not been added to the <i>N'</i> column of step 0. If you look
		at the table, you will see only a <i>u</i>. Our choices are any other node in the network;
		but because <i>x</i> has the least-cost path, it will the node added to set <i>N'</i>.
		</p>
		
		<img src="LS003.jpeg" alt="LS003.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		 
		<p>Now starting with <i>ux</i>, we see that the nodes connected to <i>x</i> are:
		<ul><li><i>v</i>, with a cost value of 3</li>
			<li><i>w</i>, with a cost value of 4</li>
			<li><i>y</i>, with a cost value of 2</li>
		</ul>
		Note that we will not be connecting <i>u</i> because it is the previous node of <i>x</i>. 
		<br><br>
		
		The values for <i>v</i> remain unchanged in this step because <i>u</i> already has a least-cost value for 
		<i>v</i> of 2 from the previous step. This value remains the same in the table.
		<br><br> 
		
		The least-cost value for <i>w</i> now has a value of 4, rather than a value of 5 from the previous 
		step. This new value for <i>w</i> is selected and entered into the table.
		<br><br>
		
		The least-cost value for <i>y</i> is now 2, which is less than infinity. This new value for <i>y</i> is
		selected and entered into the table.
		</p>

		<h4>Step 2</h4>
		<p>We have completed the first iteration. Now let us move to the second iteration. We must look for the 
		nodes that have not been added to the <i>N'</i> column of step 1. If you look at the table, you will see 
		a <i>ux</i>. Our choices are therefore <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>;
		but because <i>v</i> and <i>y</i> have the same least-cost path value, we will arbitrarily choose <i>y</i>
		and it will be added to set <i>N'</i>.
		</p>
		
		<img src="LS004.jpeg" alt="LS004.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		
		<p>Now starting with <i>uxy</i>, we see that the nodes connected to <i>y</i> are:
		<ul><li><i>w</i>, with a cost value of 3</li>
			<li><i>z</i>, with a cost value of 4</li>
		</ul>
		Note that we will not be connecting <i>x</i> because it is the previous node of <i>y</i>. 
		<br><br>
		
		The least-cost value for <i>w</i> now has a value of 3, rather than a value of 4 from the previous 
		step. This new value for <i>w</i> is selected and entered into the table.
		<br><br>
		
		The least-cost value for <i>z</i> is now 4, which is less than infinity. This new value for <i>y</i> is
		selected and entered into the table.
		</p>
		
		<img src="DT003.jpeg" alt="DT003.jpeg" style="width:480px;height:160px;" border="3">
		
		<h4>Step 3</h4>
		<p>We have completed the second iteration. Now let us move to the third iteration. We must look for the 
		nodes that have not been added to the <i>N'</i> column of step 2. If you look at the table, you will see 
		a <i>uxy</i>. Our choices are therefore <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, and <i>z</i>; but because we chose
		<i>y</i> first and <i>v</i> has the least-cost value, we will now choose <i>v</i> and it will be added to 
		set <i>N'</i>.
		</p>
		
		<img src="LS005.jpeg" alt="LS005.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		
		<p>Now starting with <i>uxyv</i>, we see that the node connected to <i>v</i> is:
		<ul><li><i>w</i>, with a least-cost value of 5</li>
		</ul>
		Note that we will not be connecting <i>u</i> or <i>x</i> because they are the previous nodes of <i>v</i>. 
		<br><br>
		
		The least-cost value for <i>w</i> from <i>u</i> is 5, rather than a value of 3 from the previous 
		step. This new value for <i>w</i> is <b>not</b> selected because it is not lower than 3.
		</p>
		
		<img src="DT004.jpeg" alt="DT004.jpeg" style="width:480px;height:160px;" border="3">
		
		<h4>Step 4</h4>
		<p>We have completed the third iteration. Now let us move to the fourth iteration. We must look for the 
		nodes that have not been added to the <i>N'</i> column of step 3. If you look at the table, you will see 
		a <i>uxyv</i>. Our choices are therefore <i>w</i> and <i>z</i>;
		but because <i>w</i> has the least-cost path value, we will choose <i>w</i> and it will be added to set 
		<i>N'</i>.
		</p>
		
		<img src="LS006.jpeg" alt="LS006.jpeg" style="width:309px;height:209px;" border="3">
		
		<p>Now starting with <i>uxyvw</i>, we see that the node connected to <i>w</i> is:
		<ul><li><i>z</i>, with a least-cost value of 8</li>
		</ul>
		Note that we will not be connecting <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, or <i>y</i> because they are the previous nodes of <i>z</i>. 
		<br><br>
		
		The least-cost value for <i>z</i> from <i>u</i> is 8, rather than a value of 4 from the previous 
		steps. This new value for <i>z</i> is <b>not</b> selected because it is not lower than 4.
		</p>
		
		<img src="DT005.jpeg" alt="DT005.jpeg" style="width:480px;height:160px;" border="3">		
		
		<p>We have now found the least-cost path from the source node <i>u</i> to the destination node <i>z</i> with a
		least-cost value of 4. We do not need to perform any additional iterations.</p>
