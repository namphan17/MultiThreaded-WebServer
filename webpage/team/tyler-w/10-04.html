	<h3>The Protocol Stack</h3>
	
	<h4>Application Layer</h4>
	<p>The application layer is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside.
	   The application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in
	   one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information, called <b>messages</b>, with the application in another
	   end system. Some of these protocols include:</p>
	   <ul><li>HTTP, which provides for web-document requests and transfers</li>
	       <li>SMTP, which provides the transfer of e-mail messages</li>
		   <li>FTP, which provides for the transfer of files between two end systems</li>
	   </ul>	
	<h4>Transport Layer</h4>
	<p>The transport layer transports application-layer messages, called <b>segments</b>, between application endpoints. There are two
	   transport protocols:</p>
	   <ul><li>TCP, which provides a connection-oriented service to its applications. It guarantees delivery of
	           application-layer messages to the destination and flow control (sender/reciever speed matching).</li>
	       <li>UDP, which provides a connectionless service to its applications. It provides no reliability,
		       no flow control, and no congestion control.</li>
	   </ul>
	<h4>Network Layer</h4>
	<p>The network layer is repsonsible for moving network-layer packets, called <b>datagrams</b>, from one host to another. The
	   transport-layer protocol in a source host passes a transport-layer segment and a destination address
	   to the network-layer. The network-layer then provides the service of delivering the segment to the
	   transport-layer in the destination host. The internet's network layer includes the <b>IP
	   protocol</b>, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act
	   on these fields.</p>
	
	<h4>Link Layer</h4>
	<p>The network-layer routes datagrams through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet
	   from one node to the next node in the route, the network-layer relies on the link-layer. At each node, the
	   network-layer passes the datagrams down to the link layer, which delivers the packets, called <b>frames</b>, to the next 
	   node along the route. Examples of link-layer protocols include:</p>
	   <ul><li>Ethernet</li>
	       <li>Wi-Fi</li>
		   <li>DOCSIS</li>
	   </ul>	
	   
	<h4>Physical Layer</h4>
	<p>The physical layer moves the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next. The protocols in this layer are
	   link-dependent and further depend on the actual transmission medium of the link. Examples of these mediums are:</p>
	   <ul><li>Twisted-pair copper wire</li>
	       <li>Single-mode fiber optic cable</li>
		   <li>Coaxial cable</li>
	   </ul>
