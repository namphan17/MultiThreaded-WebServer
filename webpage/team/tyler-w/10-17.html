		<h3>The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm</h3>
		
		<p>The link-state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra's algorithm. It computes the least-cost path from one
		node, the source, to all other nodes in the network. The algorithm is iterative and has the property that after the
		<i>k</i>th iteration of the algorithm, the least-cost paths are known to <i>k</i> destination nodes. Of all the
		least-cost paths to all destination nodes, these <i>k</i> paths will have the <i>k</i> smallest costs.</p>
		
		<ul><li><i>D(v)</i>: cost of the least-cost path from the source node to destination <i>v</i> as of this iteration
		of the algorithm</li><br>
		<li><i>p(v)</i>: previous node (neighbor of <i>v</i>) along the current least-cost path from the source to <i>v</i></li><br>
		<li><i>N'</i>: subset of nodes; <i>v</i> is in <i>N'</i> if the least-cost path from the source to <i>v</i> is
		definitively known</li><br>
		</ul>

		<p>When the algorithm terminates, we get each node's predecessor along the least-cost path from the source node. For
		each predecessor we have its predecessor, so an entire path can be contructed from the source to all destinations. The
		forwarding table in a node can then be constructed by storing this information for each destination, the next-hop node
		on the least-cost path from <i>u</i> to the destination.</p>
		
		<p>How much computation must be done in the worst case to find the least-cost paths from the source to all destinations?</p>
		
		<ul><li>In the first iteration, search through all <i>n</i> nodes to determine the node <i>w</i>, not in <i>N'</i>, that
		has the minimum cost</li><br>
			<li>In the second iteration, check <i>n</i> - 1 nodes to determine the minimum cost</li><br>
			<li>In the third iteration, check <i>n</i> - 2 nodes, and so on...</li><br>
			<li>Overall, the total number of nodes needed to search though over all the iterations is
			<i>n</i>(<i>n</i> + 1) / 2, meaning worst-case complexity of order <i>n</i> squared</li><br></ul>
