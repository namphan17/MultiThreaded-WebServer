	<h3>Client-Server and Peer-To-Peer Applications</h3>
	
	<h4> What is a Client-Server Application?</h4>
	<p>This is a type of application where a host that is always running, called a <i>server</i>, services requests from
	   many other hosts, called <i>clients</i>. These clients do not communicate directly with each other, but with the
	   server itself. The server must be appropriately scaled to the expected workload. An example a of client-server 
	   application is the website for a bank, where the client requests data from the bank's servers.</p>
	
	<h4> What is a Peer-to-Peer Application?</h4>
	<p>In this type of application, two or more computers, or peers, pool their resources and communicate in a
	decentralized network, meaning that they connect to each other rather than a server. A benefit of using
	peer-to-peer, or P2P, applications is its self-scalability; however there are many set backs:</p>
	<ul><li><b>Not ISP Friendly</b>: Most residential ISPs have been dimensioned for "asymmetrical" bandwidth usage.</li>
	    <li><b>Security Flaws</b>: P2P connections are very vulnerable due to their highly distributed and open nature.</li>
		<li><b>Incentives</b>: Many people must be convinced to volunteer their resources to applications, which can be a challenge.</li>
    </ul>
